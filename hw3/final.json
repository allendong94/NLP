We moved to the 1st floor the next day and within minutes found a centipede on the wall and15 flies. We asked for a broom to get rid of the centipede. Later in the day the receptionist said she gave us something to control the bugs. We never complained about the drain flies so she must have noticed a problem. That night we spent 2 hrs catching 6 centipedes in our room. 2 came from throw pillows. We asked reception for a new room or hotel but there supposedly werent any hotels with open rooms and if we wanted leave we would have to pay for transportation and both hotels. The next morning we went to reception to tell them about the bug problem. We barely said anything before the woman apologized and said they didnt put the bugs in the room on purpose so we should just go about our day and forget it. She added that she often goes on vacation with her children and sometimes things happen, so she tries to make the best of everything and not start a war.

And to finish all this off, the staff couldnt have been friendlier or more helpful. In terms of location, the hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Lido waterbus stop, then a boat takes around 15 mins to get into Venice. We didnt find this a problem at all - we knew this was going to be the case so had pre-booked transport tickets to save money. The surrounding Lido is pleasant and worth an explore in a spare couple of hours.

I requested flowers for the room as it was one of my wifes special birthdays, and yes they ordered exactly as requested, cant ask for more. Rooms are a little on the small side but in line with most European hotels of this standard so wasnt a surprise or a problem, room and bathroom was cleaned every day with fresh towels supplied each day. Buffet breakfast had various options to suit most peoples taste but It was a surprise to see sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs available, must have been put on to satisfy us Brits! We stayed during late September so the Lido is probably quieter at that time however we felt very safe walking around late at night back to the hotel but taxis are available if you feel a little vulnerable. Restaurants and coffee bars are located in the main commercial area close to the Waterbus stations and tend to be slightly cheaper than in Venice. We had a water taxi (think luxury speed boat!) from the airport to the hotel and back again, quite an experience, a little costly but well worth it, a lot quicker and less hassle than the Waterbus. Venice was very busy during the day time, St Marks Square at night is a must, fantastic atmosphere.

The doors are a little thin and since the building is old, the soundproofing needs improvement. The quarters are cramped, but the room comes with breakfast.

Even has a lap pool (not sure if it was olympic size though). All gears and equipment are provided free of charge so no need to bring racquets, balls and even shoes. Just make sure to wear or bring socks but worry not as they sell socks if you happen to forget. We all enjoyed our stay. From my wife getting pampered inside their spa for most of the time to me and our teenage kids working a lot of sweat playing all sorts of sports. The only thing that was somewhat awkward for us was that their recreational pool was filled wth mostly small kids and toddlers with their Soccer Moms or the Rich Wives of Beverly hills type of women. Not really encouraging for a full grown man who likes to drink his cold beer by the pool or teenage kids/young adults doing their horsing around or whatever. Their lap pool is always occupied and Waiting a while for a lane to be vacant somewhat takes the fun out of it. Over all, Its a magnificent place to stay with so many things to enjoy while youre at it. And as my title says, Its a Country Club with a little touch of Hotel!",

There were a few hiccups in our stay, but we had such a nice time that the things that did go wrong are forgiven. The staff did try their best to makeup for the mishaps, which shows that they do care about their guests. I will say the bathrooms are very small (when you open the door there is only about 5 inches from the door to the toilet). The vanity and mirror is spacious, but definitely not for 2 people at once. The Trellis Spa and service from its staff is impeccable, and the gym and outdoor amenities makeup for the age of the hotel. It is hidden away from the busy roads and noise of the surrounding area, so you really feel like you are able to relax as if you were somewhere far away. The views out the windows all around the hotel are views of beautiful tress, as if you were in a secluded rainforest. As other reviewers mentioned, the valet service was really top notch and on their game. We will definitely be returning for a staycation at The Houstonian again.

I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room.

Beyond that, the rates were low enough for a lower income (the drunk was uninsured) disabled man and his K9 assistant. The owners treated us wonderfully, as they treat their property. What a great place to spend a week in paradise. After the grueling Chicago winter we have suffered (08-09), this motel felt like our home away from home, and we would definitely choose them if we ever would go to Ft Lauderdale again.

What was strange was how closely the breakfast bar attendant watched my every move. I think she was trying to be responsive, but she asked me what I was looking for every time I glanced at the selections. The cons for me were the age of the furniture and fixtures and the cleanliness. I have never cited cleanliness in a review-I can let a lot of things pass. But I cannot accept obvious, fresh stains on both the bath vanity and kitchenette counter, especially when they wipe away easily with water, suggesting that not even a rag was dragged across them. The hotel staff was very nice, but always a turn-off for me when they walk in from their cigarette break at the front of the hotel as you walk in behind them. Surprisingly this hotel and the Wingate were nearly equally ranked (and priced) on this site. They are not similar in quality. I checked out the Wingate while in town.

It was by no means the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in but was rather poorly designed,especially in the bathroom closet area. Finding the promised coffee maker was a bit of a challenge -- it was hidden in the cabinet under the sink. Similarly the one waste basket was hidden in a back corner behind the toilet. The toilet and bath/shower were in a separate compartment with a ridiculous door that was just about impossible to close. I didn't try. The shower/bath combo had sliding glass doors that made it very awkward to use also -- a curtain would have been far better. Much of the closet space was totally inaccessible with a floor mounted safe facing sideways -- would have been a challenge to use. The toilet was extraordinarily low,as was the one easy chair in the room. It took a long time for the electric wall heater to warm the room and its contents to a comfortable temperature tho it was not that cold outside yet. Other than this,it was a nice enough room with a decent view. Not only was there a hefty fee for parking,it turned out that valet parking was mandatory and that parking seemed in very short supply.

The main drawbacks of the hotel are the small size of the room and the lack of sound deadening between rooms. At check-in,the person tried to upgrade us to a larger room (for 60 more a night) however,since we were already paying over 200 a night,we declined to upgrade. Anyway,the room we were in was next to a utility room with a loud hot water heater that cycled on and off all night. Also,the walls were so thin that we could hear the conversations of the people next to us. To top it off,there were two rooms near us with barking dogs one two doors down and one right across the hall. We found out later that they put the people with pets on the first floor therefore,I suggest that you request a room off of the first floor if you don't want to hear pet noises.

He told me that the hotel staff allowed him to park there because he was delivering furniture to the hotel. When were checking out at 10:30 AM,we waited about 15 minutes for the elevator. The delay was due to the hotel staff using the elevator to move new furniture to the upper floors. This would have been OK between 11:30 AM and 3:00PM (after checkout time and before check in time).

Breakfast was great. you can make regular waffles or blueberry waffles. eggs,sausage,fruits,danishes,muffins,toasts,yogurts. coffee,apple juice,orange juice. all you can eat. The only thing the hotel should invest in is a shuttle or someway to help get the out of town people can get to and from the beach. Also maybe upgrade the cable. Some movie channels and a guide of somesort would be nice. since it is so HOT it would be nice to stay in some a/c and watch a good movie. We were down for a wedding and did not have a car. I had read on other reviews that you can walk places and there are things to do. That is not even true. You can not walk to anything quickly. And you don't want to because it is so hot that it is miserable to walk anywhere. You need a car. Also on the way to your hotel stop and get water. The water all over Bonita Springs is awful.

I didn't know what it was at first,so I asked the guy at the front desk to come check it out. He was very helpful and nice. All the staff were very friendly. However,I will probably not be staying at another AmericInn and cannot recommend it due to the 100 dollar authorization hold that took about a week to come off of my bank account. I've never had a hold for that long while staying at a hotel. All in all it was a minor inconvenience and did not break the bank for me,but I don't think a hold needs to last that long. I called AmericInn about it,and the lady on the phone told me that it depends on however you paid and that it can take 3-10 days for the hold to come off.

MY experience is it is typical for hotels to refund canceled reservations if they are 36 hours in advance. What right has a hotel to do refuse to refund w sufficient notice. That should not be legal. Would you buy clothes or tools at a shop that had no refund policy They do it because they know they are only one of two hotels in this impoverished little town.

First, they do not have any roll-away beds available while other hotels in the area do offer them, and this made for awkward sleeping arrangements for the 3 in our group. Secondly, we came for a bicycle ride and since we didn't want to leave the bikes on the outside of the car overnight we planned on bringing them into the room, but the desk attendant stopped us and said the policy was no bikes in the rooms. On the plus side they were using the conference room as staging area for renovation material and he let us lock our bikes in that room overnight which was actually better, but if not under construction I am afraid this wouldn't be the case. In an area where there is a large amount of bicycle tourism not being able to bring the bike inside is a definite negative, though I do understand that with nice new rooms they don't want the dirt and grime of bikes being tracked inside.

The lobby has a couple of attractive and comfortable seating areas, in addition to a small bar. I had a lovely double room with its own patio, a spacious and beautifully appointed bathroom, and ample closet space. There was also a mini-bar and in-room safe. The hotel provides free wireless internet and it is quite fast. Breakfast was included, and was quite elaborate: fruit, cheeses, charcuterie, breads, eggs, bacon, juices. Coffee drinks are provided on request. There is a rooftop terrace with tables, chairs, and umbrellas for warm, sunny days... alas, I was there in winter!

When the key was handed over no one mentioned that there were 2 stone steps down into the room and this made entry quite dangerous as the door opened inward and therefore just switching on the light to see meant you had to lean over the drop. The room was very small and was barely big enough for 2 people let along us and the two dogs. There were no tea or coffee making kit in the rooms so room service has to be used. The hotel restaurant is too small to accommodate the number of guests at breakfast meaning that groups of 3 or more people often have to wait to be seated after couples. During the summer they use the sun terrace to accommodate more people but this was October, if the terrace were covered by a glass conservatory it would make it an all year round space. We took dinner in the restaurant on the fist night and service was haphazard to say the least but the food was ok.

I wouldn't say don't visit the hotel but some of the weaker points are as follows: 1 - the pool is very small, the photography on the website cleverly makes it look a lot bigger than it is, if you go, like me, thinking you'll swim a few laps every morning for exercise you'll be disappointed. 2 - the hotel is noisy, especially in the older section (can't say about the new section). Doors bang and the floor is stone so you hear every little noise, plus it's quite close to the road. Take earplugs! 3 - the staff are perfunctory - every request is fulfilled (although we did ask for an iron one night that never did turn up!) but it's done so with a fairly blank face - with the exception of 1 of the restaurant waitresses who was much friendlier and one of the receptionists who was also much friendlier.

Secondly we were told we would have our own bartender to take care of our group seeing as there were 60 people at the event. We only saw 2 bartenders behind the bar 3 times that night. Most of the time there was only 1 bartender for the whole bar and had several people mention how long it took to get a drink.

The small pool and tub were still nice. Also they used to have hair dryers in the baths but no longer. So it used to be good value and I see that Labor Day they are advertising the old price, but a valet for that garage is completely tacky and just an obvious attempt to get another dollar.

There was also a fresh farmers market in the town square literally steps from the hotel. I really enjoyed all the fresh produce and baked goods for sale there. The only thing I was unhappy with at the hotel was the parking garage. It is so small and it was packed when we checked in. Once we finally found a spot we chose to not even drive our vehicle as to not have to encounter that stressful dilemma again! Another issue was that the room did not have a microwave. If one stays several nights and has left overs from a restaurant you can not re-heat anything in your room. Plus the room comes with a refrigerator but they pack it with their items they want you to purchase so that was also a hassle I just took theirs own and put mine in until I was about to leave and then restocked it with their items. Other than that I thought the hotel was nice and very conveniently located.",

I have stayed at many 5 star hotels and had not-so-great experiences ... this one was a breath of fresh air.From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, everyone was always smiling, pleasant and very helpful. We were checked in very quickly and our room (two double beds) was big, very clean and smelled nice. The bathroom was so sparkling clean that my son (who is very picky) couldn't wait to take a bath (FYI, we are generally shower people.) Yes, the a/c unit can be loud, but when you're tired from a day of sightseeing and full from a big dinner ... all I can say is that I slept very well. I personally would have preferred a firmer mattress but that is really the only complaint I can make. When I realized that I had left my toothbrush and showercap at home, I called the front desk and housekeeping was at my door in 5 minutes with complimentary toiletries. As for Wi-Fi, just sign up on their website to join their club (no charge) and you will get your internet for free. I even read that you can get coupons for some free mini-bar use.My brother and his wife were on the trip with us and their room, with a king bed, was smaller than ours. Being from Europe, they are not fans of a/c to begin with and the loud noise theirs was making made it hard for them to sleep. They finally called guest services to complain because they couldn't turn if off either and were immediately moved to another room (just to sleep in) for the night. The next day while we were out, they had an engineer come in and fix the unit. By the time we came back, it was working fine and there was a bottle of wine waiting for them for their troubles.I did like the decor of the lobby ... colorful and eclectic but in a nice way. The location itself was great because it was so close to great shops and restaurants. There is a french cafe next door which was great for breakfast. We tried dinner at the restaurant downstairs ... although my dinner was good (bucket of fried chicken), my brother felt that the ribs and BBQ chicken were a bit dry. Overall, not worth the money we spent. The wait staff, however, was very efficient and friendly.The next night we tried an Italian restaurant up the street ... Bartucci's. This place was great! Their pastas were homemade and the seafood was fresh and cooked perfectly. Great wine selection also. This place was worth it and we will definitely go back next time we are in town.Overall, I found our stay very satisfying and reasonably priced. Checkout was quick and they even e-mailed me my bill.

Waited an hour before getting two cups of tea, served piecemeal; first I got my pot, minutes later my wife got her pot, and 10 minutes later we got our tea bags.  We waited an hour between our order and the time it was served and my wife never got her toast for her eggs.  The manager came round and apologized for the poor service and said they were just overwhelmed.

In the spirit of full disclosure, I did not bring this up with anyone until I was checking out. I was only staying for 2 nights and only needed the iron 1 of the mornings. My other negative was - while I was toweling off after my morning shower, I noticed a long strand of dark hair hanging off my shoulder. This was a bit gross as it clearly wasn't mine - I am pretty much bald with only a bit of peach-fuzz on the sides, which is mostly grey. It clearly must have come off the towel, which makes you wonder a bit about their laundry regime. Although, it could also have come off the cleaning staff when they were replacing the towels in the room. Either way a little icky from my perspective.

My room was very comfortable and included many thoughtful details - plush bathrobe, yoga mat, minibar with a variety of snacks, lots of regular and USB outlets, free wifi. The hotel was in great shape, and I appreciated the free coffee service in the morning and wine happy hour in the afternoon. I was delighted to discover that the hotel has bikes that are free for guests' use - I wish I had been able to use them more than once! My room service breakfast was pricey but delicious and arrived exactly when ordered. And I was delighted to receive a surprise from the hotel one afternoon - a bottle of wine and a plate of snacks!

The sink and counter is outside that space in an area next to the door of the room is not screened off in any way from the bedroom section. As a disabled person, I frequently take sponge baths at the bathroom sink. In this situation there was absolutely no privacy to do so, which was inconvenient for me. If all you do at the sink is brush your teeth comb your hair, this won't be an issue for you. But I didn't like the thought of people using the toilet, then using the doorknob with unwashed hands to get out to the area to wash their hands. Besides inconvenient, it seemed unhygienic to me.

The only negative I would state is that the carpets need cleaning badly. Every time I got in the shower I left dirty footprints, and, due to diabetic foot problems, I do not walk outside bare footed. The only place the soil could have come from was within the room.",

They -advertised a continental breakfast, microwave and refrigerator and sounded just right for our needs. In reality, there was a micro with the door broken off, so as long as you could pry the door open you were in business! As for the continental breakfast, well, it supposedly went from 7-10, but when we came in at 8:30 the bins with some little rolls and english muffins were almost empty and I watched as the lady ahead of me grabbed the last one and no refills were coming. there was one kind of cereal and a couple packets of oatmeal and milk plus coffee and some juice. If everything was about gone at 8:30, imagine coming in an hour later...The hotel didn't seem to be all that busy either. All in all, the hotel was certainly tolerable, but not quite what they lead you to believe.",
