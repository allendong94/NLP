Very good. The only problem was their room keys were not working. So every time you returned to your room. Someone had to escort you, and let you in. I was told that I would get a 20.00 credit for the problem. We would stay there again for sure.	facility,service
This was a very nice hotel. The staff was particularly friendly and helpful, the complimentary breakfast was great, and they had the most comfortable beds I have slept in at a hotel! Would highly recommend.	service,food
Good experience and very convenient to where I needed to be. Hotel was quiet and staff polite and helpful. Conveniently located between two restaurants that serve decent food at reasonable prices. Only downside was that hotel room was a bit dusty... not unclean but bedside lamp had dust on base. Very well out-fitted with outlets, however, which is needed these days. Overall, I was very pleased with my stay.	environment,location
This was a true nightmare. The add stated it was oceanfront, it wasnt! the front door would not lock. It had gray duct on the lock section, which was painted it over. It appeared to be a place for squatters. It was not safe. The furniture was old, outdated and it smelled. And we couldnt get a refund!	environment,facility
Full of cockroach. Smelly carpet. Super expensive for the hotel.	facility,environment
location in a little tough to navigate as it only in approachable from one way and exiting can be slightly tricky. However, the hotel room was clean, nice, and the bathroom was decent. The breakfast was a good assortment of dry goods to choose from.	facility,food
I was looking for an inexpensive but clean motel. It met all my needs, no unnecessary frills but the staff provided adequate service. Room was clean and check-in, checkout procedure was uncomplicated. Easy access to PA turnpike and Route 22	service,location
I reserved this room through hotels.com. I selected a non-smoking room. I was given a smoking room. I asked the desk cleark to move me and was told there were no other rooms. Later that evening a fight broke out down the hall. The local police came(4 cars) in a brawl insued. After arresting the two hotel guests, things quite need down some. The rest if the night there was activity if some sort coming and going I would highly discourage anyone from staying in this location.	service,environment
We reserved 2 rooms, 1 had a bad smell the other smelled like marijuana. The AC/heat unit was so loud that it woke the family everytime it kicked on. The shower didnt drain and the toilet didnt flush. The light between the bed was broken and did not turn on. The pillows on the queen beds were the size of a throw pillow for a couch. The motel needs to be razed and started over.	facility
Good location for East Peoria hotel. Hotel seemed new. Rooms very clean. Parking lot was well let. Breakfast was good and free. I like the suite style rooms, although they are a bit small. Good for a night or town out of town. Would stay again.	food,location
Great location but tired hotel. Our room had dirty rugs, scuffed walls and terrible scratchy rough sheets. Terrific staff makes staying here worthwhile. There was a drunk man in our hall that was handled promptly by the superb desk clerk.	environment,service
Great price for value. The a/c was cranking when we got to our room. This continued for the duration of the week, and since it was high in the 90s, made for a comfortable nights sleep. The pillows and linens were very snuggly and soft. It felt safe to stay there all by myself. It was a few blocks further away from the beach than I expected. Im glad I upgraded to the room with the refrigerator.	facility,location
Pleasant 10 min walk along the sea front to the Water Bus. restaurants etc. Hotel was comfortable breakfast was good - quite a variety. Room aircon didnt work very well. Take mosquito repelant!	food,location,facility
Really lovely hotel. Stayed on the very top floor and were surprised by a Jacuzzi bath we didnt know we were getting! Staff were friendly and helpful and the included breakfast was great! Great location and great value for money. Didnt want to leave!	facility,service,location
We stayed here for four nights in October. The hotel staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful. Assisted in booking tickets for the opera. The rooms were clean and comfortable- good shower, light and airy rooms with windows you could open wide. Beds were comfortable. Plenty of choice for breakfast.Spa at hotel nearby which we used while we were there.	environment,food,facility,service
We loved staying on the island of Lido! You need to take a water is from Venice to get there. From the train station, a boat ride takes 45 minutes but has beautiful views along the way. Hotel is an EASY walk from the boat dock. The room was very clean and the breakfast was plentiful. We would definitely recommend this hotel!	environment,location
Lovely view out onto the lagoon. Excellent view. Staff were welcoming and helpful.	environment,service

Nice hotel , with very friendly staff and helpful - great choice for breakfast , something for everyone.	food,service
DONT stay here unless youre less than 2 feet tall or like sleeping with centipedes. Our 4th floor room was an attic with a vaulted ceiling that angles down to 3ft. The bed is only accessible from one side. If you placed your head in the skylight on the other side you might able sit up. The bathtub was impractical with broken shower head. We moved to the 1st floor the next day and within minutes found a centipede on the wall and15 flies. We asked for a broom to get rid of the centipede. Later in the day the receptionist said she gave us something to control the bugs. We never complained about the drain flies so she must have noticed a problem. That night we spent 2 hrs catching 6 centipedes in our room. 2 came from throw pillows. We asked reception for a new room or hotel but there supposedly werent any hotels with open rooms and if we wanted leave we would have to pay for transportation and both hotels. The next morning we went to reception to tell them about the bug problem. We barely said anything before the woman apologized and said they didnt put the bugs in the room on purpose so we should just go about our day and forget it. She added that she often goes on vacation with her children and sometimes things happen, so she tries to make the best of everything and not start a war. Adding, a few euros isnt going to make anything go away so we should just go enjoy the day because more we talk the less time we have.	environment,facility,service
We had absolutely no problems whatsoever with this hotel and were very pleasantly surprised by the quality considering the low price. The dcor of the room was pleasant and flawless, unlike many of the Venice hotels Ive stayed in. The breakfast buffet was delicious too. And to finish all this off, the staff couldnt have been friendlier or more helpful. In terms of location, the hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Lido waterbus stop, then a boat takes around 15 mins to get into Venice. We didnt find this a problem at all - we knew this was going to be the case so had pre-booked transport tickets to save money. The surrounding Lido is pleasant and worth an explore in a spare couple of hours. In conclusion, I would book this again due to the fantastic quality of the hotel, despite the trade-off of not being in Venice itself.	food,service,location
Lovely hotel, 10 min walk to the water bus stop on lido. Away from the madness of Venice, but close enough to be there in less than 20 minutes.	location
Located on the Lido I would recommend this hotel if you require a little piece and quiet after the busy days in Venice, facilitys good, staff very friendly and very helpful. I requested flowers for the room as it was one of my wifes special birthdays, and yes they ordered exactly as requested, cant ask for more. Rooms are a little on the small side but in line with most European hotels of this standard so wasnt a surprise or a problem, room and bathroom was cleaned every day with fresh towels supplied each day. Buffet breakfast had various options to suit most peoples taste but It was a surprise to see sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs available, must have been put on to satisfy us Brits! We stayed during late September so the Lido is probably quieter at that time however we felt very safe walking around late at night back to the hotel but taxis are available if you feel a little vulnerable. Restaurants and coffee bars are located in the main commercial area close to the Waterbus stations and tend to be slightly cheaper than in Venice. We had a water taxi (think luxury speed boat!) from the airport to the hotel and back again, quite an experience, a little costly but well worth it, a lot quicker and less hassle than the Waterbus. Venice was very busy during the day time, St Marks Square at night is a must, fantastic atmosphere. All in all we had a great time in Venice, it can be a little expensive so dont ponder over the bills to much, just pay up with a smile!	environment,food,facility,service,location
Great stay...close to ferry.food not so good nearby	food,location
Stayed with parents, wife twin toddlers in two triple rooms. The hotel is easy to reach and the rooms were well placed well furnished. The best feature was extremely friendly helpful staff, particularly Ms. Annalucia Ms. Anna who were always ready to listen help out with big smiles. The breakfasts were very good, with good spread and the guests were made welcome to sit and eat at leisure (more important when you are with toddlers!) Would surely go back to Venice would happily stay again at Russo Palace.	environment,service,food,location
This hotel is in Lido which is a better choice than staying in crowded Venice. The water bus is very convenient and it takes only few more stops to the main attractions in Venice. We received excellent service - many thanks to Anna and Donnatella who made us feel at home.	service,location
It was a 10 min+ walk to water bus, would have liked it closer. Located on the water on Lido island, away from the rush of Venice	location

Really enjoyed the stay, about a 10min walk to the main waterbus station. Had the perfect quiet location and staff were really friendly!!	service,location
Walls extremely thin, you can hear everything. Excessive hoovering every morning outside bedroom. There. Is a bar, but no one to tend it.	service,facility,environment
If youre looking for a hotel where the action is, go elsewhere. The hotel is on the Lido, which is about a 10-15 minute waterbus ride away from Venice. However, if youre looking for a place on the Lido, this is a well-priced option. The staff was great with handling/recommending dinner reservations, even during an insane Carnevale weekend. The doors are a little thin and since the building is old, the soundproofing needs improvement. The quarters are cramped, but the room comes with breakfast. If we wanted to stay on the Lido again, this would be a good option, but next time I think well opt for a place closer to the action. Recommended.	service,food,location,facility
Hotel facilities are good and breakfast ample. Econmy rooms have sloping roof so tall guests mind your head We stayed in one and it was fine, the occational bump but for the price you cant really complain.	food,facility
Friendly reception very helpful. Hotel has pleasant views and is about ten minute walk to main water bus terminal to take you any direction. We used the spa one day. Good saunas but relaxation area noisy and small. Some lovely restaurants close by and cheaper than in Venice.	service,location,facility

Close to Venice and decent hotel, breakfast was okay with no too much selection but has everything you need.	food,location
beautiful views of Venice in the lovely relaxed calmer area of Lido Di Venezia. Gorgeous sunsets and very easy to access Venice, rather than staying in the hustle and bustle. Close to only beaches in Venice. Staff were so helpful, especially Ivan and the lady we met on the desk each morning.	service,location
This is a great little hotel. We had a wonderful view from the room and patio. Good size. Breakfast was great even had North American breakfast foods. Only issue was the two twin beds pushed together. That was very uncomfortable.	food,location,facility
Nice staff. Nice location. We booked two nights at Russo hotel on Lido strip and two nights in the very center of Venice. This is a good balance. Lido is a bit further but it feels more local and is more relaxing too, it gave us a taste of Dolce Vita. We didnt see it on the hotel description but they offered us a taxi boat ride to Murano with another couple for free. The boat ride was very pleasant, they dropped us in a glass blowing factory shop, the glass making demonstration was nice and there was very little pressure to buy. Internet was free for 20 minutes/day but a bit slow like everywhere in Venice. So in short a good pick, good value for money.	service,location,facility
Nice and clean. Rooms are spacious with air conditioning. Good selection of breakfast. Within easy reach of San Marco. Quite location.	environment,food,location,facility
We had a wonderful, relaxing time. The staff were completely attentive and accommodating. We had a corner king room with a kitchen, two patios and a deluxe bathroom. You had to drive into town but they said that Uber is available if you need it. This was our first visit to Palm Springs and hopefully not our last!	service,facility
We were in Palm Springs on the day the temperature was 123 degrees! Despite that, we had a wonderful stay because of the Little Paradise hotel. The staff were friendly and accommodating, and all of the little complimentary touches were so nice, like a bottle of wine for us in the fridge, sun care products near the pool.	service,food,facility
We arrived in Palm Springs not sure what to expect....its a quiet kinda place in low season....we drove down what appeared to be a residential street...parked up at a wooden gate and werent sure what to expect. What awaited took us back in amazement...the room is spacious with an air of decadence...the welcome wine and comprehensive breakfast was more	environment,food,facility
This place really is a little paradise!! A beautiful boutique style hotel with EVERYTHING meticulously thought out to make our vacation perfect. Saltwater pool, fresh fruit, BEST showerhead Ive ever experienced, I can go on and on. The bed was so comfortable and we slept like babies. Victor did a wonderful job and Judy was just lovely and personable!	service,food,facility
Spent 3 nights at Little Paradise boutique hotel on a mother-daughter trip. Wonderful and relaxing experience. Clean and newly redone rooms that are well equipped and spacious. Perfect location off the main street in a quiet neighborhood that is close to downtown Palm Springs. The pool area has a nice gas fire pit area and lots of comfy chaise lounges.	environment,location,facility
This little hotel surpassed all my expectations. The rooms are well equiped with a little kitchenette, fridge was filled with croissants, 3 bottles of water, soda and much more. The room was very clean and the bathroom was equiped with a top notch shower. I would definately recommend this place to anyone visiting or passing trough Palm Springs.	food,facility
If you want peaceful and relaxing look no further. Although set up like a single floor motel it is hardly anything but. The rooms are very nice with a full kitchen. They provide some breakfast items, snacks and bottles of spring water. You can bring in anything you like to enjoy at the pool or in your room.	food,facility
All the reviews are great and agree on this fine little place. Id also like to add the wonderful service you will find here with Victor and staff who seem to want to do anything and everything to make you happy. The king beds here are just amazing. We seldom run into beds this comfy. The room has a large.	service,facility
We went for a relaxing weekend as an offshoot of a family visit. This was a great place to go with a nice room and a view of the mountains from just outside. The ONLY thing we didnt like was that the sun dropped below the mountains too early and the temperature dropped along with it. Maybe you can fix.	environment,location
We were on a business trip to Anaheim and, afterwards, drove to Palm Springs for a relaxing weekend. It turned out that this hotel was the perfect place! We arrived late and were pleasantly surprised upon checking in to see that, not only were the accommodations incredibly thoughtful and comfortable, but the refrigerator came stocked with croissants, bagels, cream cheese,More.	service,food
Victor and Judy were truly accommodating hosts, especially when we had to cut our stay short due to illness. Everything that has been written by other reviewers was spot on. It is more like a small inn or bed breakfast (with the breakfast left in the fridge in your room) than a hotel. There are eight guest rooms around.	food,facility
If you want to relax, want a quiet atmosphere, cozy setting.. this is the place. It is definitely a smaller, boutique-type hotel and it feels that way. So thats good for some and maybe not as much for others. The room is great, very pretty. Very impressive large, new Curved HD TV. So thats nice! The small kitchen is also good.	environment,,facility
Stayed 5 nights and it was delightful. Lovely comfortable,well lit, great shower and bathroom,kitchen with microwave,fridge etc and very functional room. Ten hotels on this trip but this one seems to have thought of everything. Peaceful yet near the main streets with lovely shopping, art and some great restaurants. Good local transport but downtown is walkable but a bit over.	location,facility
New everything would be great from the moment we came through the gate. Nine excellent, high quality rooms each with a small kitchen/diner and terrific shower room including twin wash basins. Each room faces onto the pool with plenty of sun loungers, towels, shaded areas and comfortable seating. Rooms furnished to extremely high standard and beds have the finest linen.	environment,facility
Spend four days there and would have prolonged our stay if they only had a room available. Welcoming host, all rooms around the patio / pool. This place breathes tranquility and relaxation. Since you normally travel by car in this country anyways, everything is close by.	location,facility
Im going to keep this fairly short but what I will say is if you are going to stay in Palm Springs please stay here. Its not right on the main drag but its in a lovely residential area, no noise, ample parking and just so peaceful. Only 5 in an Uber to the main strip with the bars.	environment,location
We had unit 4 on the east side of the complex for 3 nights - very quiet, very comfortable bed, nice amenities in room - killer shower!! pool was large, heated, wonderful - Judy hope I got that right made us fresh orange and banana smoothies when we were in the pool - breakfast in fridge was just ok.	food,facility
Stayed 3 nights in this beautiful hotel. This place is very clean, rooms have all been recently upgraded. Big comfortable bed, nice kitchen with granite countertops, fridge, Keurig coffee maker, and even a two burner stove. Bathrooms are big with granite countertops, two sinks, and a huge shower. Pool area is gorgeous and the owner and staff make you feel.	environment,facility
This place is just perfect for everyone looking for some rest in lovely and warm Palm Springs. The host welcomed us very very friendly, explaining us what we could find where. The private kitchen had our breakfast and a complimentary bottle of wine. The room (call it the apartment) had everything and was very well decorated and had an outside.	service,food,facility
Little Paradise is called a hotel, but it is more of a motel tucked away in a nice neighborhood district with similar styled single story boutique motels/hotels. This is not your large chain full service hotel but a nice hideaway with just a few rooms surrounding a warm salt water swimming pool. There is no on-site restaurant.	service,facility
If you are being treated at any Texas Medical Center facility this is a good place to stay. Very clean, decent breakfast, and shuttle. The only negative is that the shuttle doesnt run in the middle of the day making it inconvenient to return to the hotel following an appointment. We have had to take a taxi a few times.	environment,facility
Pathetic and discriminatory. They have a free shuttle service, but it is not accessible to wheelchair users, and they dont care. The front desk did not do anything about the issue. I emailed the corporate customer care email address and they take unreasonable amounts of time to respond to emails and do not remedy the problem. The customer care email.	service,facility
This Comfort Suites was a terrific hotel. The staff was friendly and the room was clean and a good size. There was great food for breakfast and a large variety. It was very convenient for our trip. We went to an Astros game and the drive was about 18 minutes. We went to the Johnson Space Center the next day.	service,food,location
Great location walking distance to NRG Stadium. Next door to Pappa BBQ (warning- good, but very smoky flavor). Hotel was nicely decorated, gave a warm welcome. Front desk staff was friendly, though distracted. Our room, while quite large (we had an accessible room), had two ACs that did not de-humidify the room. It felt damp/humid the whole stay.	service,environment,facility
The room was clean, the hotel workers were very good and the breakfast was also good. But the kennel with the dogs was awful. These dogs starting barking at six in the morning. The television in my room was a twenty inch LG. I will never go back there again.	service,environment,food,facility
Only .3 (three tenths!) of a mile away from the Kirby St. gate of NRG Stadium. It can even be considered walking distance, and you avoid the price of parking! How nice it is to be so nearby after attending an exciting event at NRG Stadium.....saving the possibly long drive home, or to the airport, for the next day.	location,facility
On our two trips prior to this one both the breakfast and the internet were below par. I am glad to report that on our most recent trip the internet worked great and the breakfast was much improved. When you go to Texas for cancer treatment, the little things become big things. You can stay here with confidence.	food,facility
Stayed here for two nights to visit MDA. The rooms are clean. The bed is comfortable. The internet worked great. The staff was nice. Close to many restaurants. I highly recommend. We stayed at Best Western the last visit and had a total different (bad) experience.	service,environment,facility
I was a bit concerned after checking the rating of this hotel, but was so pleasantly surprised when I got there. I was basically there for a medical visit and it seemed like so were a lot of other people, but we would totally stay there if we were just visiting Houston. My mom checked in for me.	environment
We stay here each time my husband has a medical appt in Houston and they do offer medical rates if you ask. It is near medical center off of Main St. Very quiet and very clean large rooms. Several eating places within walking distance. Offers medical center shuttle also. The pool is very small, but we dont use that anyways.	environment,location,facility
Visited the comfort suites in new iberia louisiana and my daughters head was almost decapitated in the elivator.

We called numerous times before an answer.	service,facility
I have been staying here, off and on, four about 7 years. The first time was when my father was going thru treatment at MD Anderson. The staff were great, made accommodations for him and also for his caregivers. They were also very understanding for those going thru treatments also local hospitals. I have also stayed there during my pre.	service,location
Very nice, like new lobby and rooms. Lobby and halls have tile floors that look great. Fancy, large chandelier in lobby. Hotel is 13 years old but looked like it was remodeled recently.

We stayed here because of a family medical emergency.Did not have any options for a room. We had the SMALL queen room--think it may have been laundry area previously. Bed fair. Room quite. Was OK for one night. This hotel is near the stadium. Price was ok .99 plus tax.	location,facility
The room was fine and the mattress was very comfortable. Unfortunately, I arrived while the front entrance was under-construction. There was not sufficient signage to find out how to enter the building. I would have left, had I not already had a reservation through Hotels.com.	service,environment
Reprehensible three days without maid service despite telling the management after it had happened the first time. I would not recommend this hotel for this reason.	service
The pictures on the web site were more expensive looking than the reality. We were told we had one of the best rooms, besides staring at cargo containers, the TV would not work so they changed our room. It was not well furnished and we could not regulate the air conditioner (way too warm for sleeping). The continental breakfast was good and the staff was very nice and helpful. The linens were harsh and uncomfortable. Sorry, but this was not at all what I expected and it was certainly unacceptable.	food,facility
The didnt tell me they were gonna run my credit card for accidental for a 100 charge. They just told me they had to double check my ID and the credit card that was used.	service
I stayed here with some girlfriends for a wine tasting getaway. The staff pointed out some great wineries and restaurants and were very friendly.	service
Beautiful hotel. Very clean and service was great. This is a must stay and if Im in need of a hotel in the Liver more area, this is the place to stay.	service,environment
The room was big and the hotel staff were nice, but I couldnt get over the smelly linens. When I lay down on the bed, all I could smell was dirty old sweat socks! I dont think they ever used detergent or fabric softener to wash the linens!They were that horrible! I had to spray the linens with perfume so I wouldnt smell them au natural while Im sleeping! Im never going to stay in this hotel ever again!	service,environment,facility
Nice place no complaints, one thing they didnt tell me,is they put a 100 hold on your card that stays for a couple days after you check out. I know this is not rare but any place that does has told me. I ended up calling trying to get it refunded. The breakfast in morning was pretty good, they had a full buffet not just some package pastries. Leave your swimsuit at home though the pool is small very small.	food,facility
Great stay for our night downtown Liver more at Bank head Theater concert. Birthday celebration for friend. The most comfortable bed ever! Nice patio where we spent our morning catching up. Hotel under construction did not bother us.	environment,facility
The hotel was great. There was little construction going on which altered where they served breakfast, but it didnt bother us any.	food
Having never been to Liver more, imagine my shock when the 2nd floor balcony room overlooked a parking lot and a gas station with a Jack in the Box thrown in for good measure. I thought I was staying in wine country. It would also have been nice to know that it is under construction. Granted I should have done more research but it was a last minute decision to go. The only good thing I could say is the bed was comfortable. If you are looking for a hotel right off of a freeway this one fits the bill, although way overpriced.	environment,facility
The bathroom sink splashes water, need to be fixed. The bathtub/shower make loud noises. Other than that, it was a good stay.	facility
Beds and pillows were nice. And the television was good as well. The pool was closed.	facility
My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The staff were friendly, helpful and efficient. The breakfast in the morning was delicious with a good selection of food and beverages. We will definitely stay here again and refer friends and family too.	service,food
Close to freeway on/off ramp. enjoyed the stay	location
This hotel was promoted as being in the wine country. However, it was a block from the freeway. When we asked the desk clerk about this, she pointed her finger toward the door and said, Its about 4 miles that way. We had a great view of Jack in the Box parking lot. When we first entered our room and kicked off our shoes, we found ourselves stepping on numerous sand burrs left on the carpet. After working out and returning to our room at 9am, there was no hot water for the shower. The breakfast was adequate and the housekeeping staff were friendly.	service,food,location,facility
Came for concert at Wente. Last time I traveled to area the accomodations had a shuttle service. That would be a nice amenity if you could add it. Great clean place to stay.	environment,facility
Only problem we had was that we were not informed of the teen basketball tournament going on in the city. As a result, lots of kids, the room next to ours had the TV blaring until midnight and then on again a 5 am. We went to the lobby for our full breakfast at 10:15 and there was nothing left. We pickup a beagle and coffee and went to our room. They should have planned ahead for all the teens to eat all the food. There was 45 minutes left for breakfast time but nothing to eat. Outside of that, our stay was very nice. The gentleman at the front desk was especially cordial and accommodating.	service,environment,food,facility
It was cold in the room. We couldnt get the heater on easily for some reason but then when the heat temperature finally came on we were sweating in the middle of the night. I would like a better thermostat or better direction. The hot breakfast was great!!!	food,facility
All the rooms have been recently renovated. They are in the process of renovating the lobby area. The room was new and clean. The beds were very comfortable. The bed linen looks new too. Its also nice to have electrical sockets at desk level and plenty of them. The breakfast was so so... eggs, sausages and hashbrown (no fruits) but barely edible.	environment,food,facility

The hotel was great, but the Buffet Breakfast was the worst I have ever had! The bacon taste like cardboard, eggs and sausage were cold, Pastries were hard and very little fruit. The only thing hot and worth eating was fixing yourself a waffle at the waffle machine if you didnt mind waiting in line for it.	food
The Hawthorne Suites offers an affordable, comfortable environment that is convenient to the 580 freeway (just south of it) and within a mile and a half of downtown Livermore. Room was incredibly clean and comfortable. While they are currently going through a renovation, which I think will be really nice once it is completed, we rarely had any indication of the ongoing construction activities. Staff was very friendly and accommodating.	service,environment,facility

What a pleasant surprise! We are use to staying at expensive four star hotels but needed to complete a quick business trip and we were so delighted with this hotel. All newly remodeled, pleasant professional staff, and the hot breakfast was a perfect addition. Highly recommend and you will not be disappointed!	service
The hotel is absolutely beautiful. We were very impressed by the dcor everything was clean and felt very upscale. The hotel is located near the freeway. There is a gas station, fast food, and shopping nearby. We were in town for a family event so we didnt do much exploring, but there seemed to be many amenities right in the area. The best part was the proximity to downtown Livermore. Wonderful shopping and dining opportunities, and only 5 minutes away. Also, the wineries are within a 10 minute drive. All in all, a wonderful place to stay and lots to do in the area.	environment,location

All was great, until the heater/AC came on. It sounded like a vacuum cleaner every time it turned on. Waking me up over and over. The room would get to hot then to cold. Had a horrible night sleep. Vroom -- Vroom. Clean, friendly, comfy bed, all ruined by a Motel-6 quality wall unit.	environment,facility
Theres nothing wrong with the hotel except that there are flood lights shining in your window while you sleep and the curtains dont close. I really like the furniture The bedding was clean the pillows are great. Next time I will ask for a room with windows on the other side.	environment,facility
The hotel itself was very nice. Staff was very helpful, especially with accommodating us when we asked to check in early. The problem was with cleanliness. Our room was not clean enough - I found a floss stick on the table in our room. What looked like a condom was found when we went to use the spa. And the pool was full of leaves and dirt on the bottom. Otherwise, our room would have been great. Very large with everything you need for a comfortable stay. Nice large screen tv as well - made my husband happy.	environment,facility
Mediocre. The carpets and elevator reek of sour wine. Evidently they have regular wine Thursdays here. Service was somewhat lacking. I requested a wakeup call, they didnt do it. Finally, the free breakfast was on the poor side. Daddy, this bacon tastes like tuna.	service,food
Nice experience, despite the re-modeling construction. Friendly and courteous hotel staff. Beautiful new room decor and ambience.	service
One night only, but a nice one. New rennos high quality throughout. Comfy, modern accomodation. Our room overlooked grazing cattle and the relentless I-580, so it was busy, but totally silent. Well be back.	location
Guy at front desk was a jerk, smart Alec	service
When I made reservations at this hotel, I had average expectations at that that price rate for that area. However the newly renovated room, the professional staff and the cleanliness and the comfort of really surprised me and I will definitely go back.	service,environment
We stayed for two nights. The lobby was nice and the breakfast was good. However, the room was not properly cleaned upon arrival and the same issues remained on the second day. Would have expected much better at this price.	service,environment
I have stayed here twice now and loved it both times. Staff are very courteous and welcoming. The pool can use an upgrade but we still had a great time lounging next to the pool.	service,facility
Clean, safe, friendly, brand new, hotel- :)	environment
The last time I stayed at this hotel, it was under remodeling and one of the rooms I was placed in had a heating unit that did not work. I moved to another room, which was okay, but not as nice a room. This time, my granddaughter and I checked in at about 4:30 p.m. 	facility
The hotel is under renovation so lobby and other areas were blocked off. Room was very nice but breakfast were less than tasty.	environment,food
Staff was very nice. Hotel is updating its lobby and reception area so there was a bit of construction. Did not hamper anything. Breakfast was fine, room was nice and quite spacious and again hotel employees were very nice.	service,food
Great hotel in a great neighborhood. Will definitely be staying here again. Room was very spacious. Free breakfast was great! It was raining so we didnt get to use the pool but it seemed very nice. A little pricey but its a very nice hotel! Free wi-fi and free parking - additional pluses!	food,facility
Very comfortable and accommodating. From making our reservation to our time spent, the Hawthorn in Livermore was really nice. I did have to find the direct phone number to get assurance our needs would be met as the central hotel reservation system is simply not equipped to handle any details. Once accessed the staff was most gracious and reassuring.	service,facility
I work in Livermore and stayed the night to celebrate with friends. The location is close to downtown and the local wineries. My boyfriend and I were very pleased with the accommodations, the room was clean and large. The front desk was very friendly and helpful. I will stay here again.	service,environment
A nice hotel, it was undergoing renovation when I stayed so should be finished soon. Staff was helpful and friendly. Only complaint is the breakfast.	service,food
I live somewhat local in Redwood City, but its far enough away that after spending the evening with High School Friends, having a 30th gathering wasnt an official reunion, at a local beer pub, we didnt want to chance driving home after having a few beers. We made the reservation Friday night, and honestly, was apprehensive because of some of the reviews. Pleasantly surprised! The place was clean, its had a facelift and looks good. The bathroom tub could use an update...but I have stayed in the W in downtown Chicago and the tub was worse and room was horrible. Id take this room over that one any day! The breakfast the next morning was good. Nothing to write home about, but it offers a great selection and the eggs werent watered down. Sausage was good...bacon...well, that looked and smelled like a dog treat. Passed on that one. But the coffee was decent and overall, was very pleased with our last minute choice to stay there...would do it again and would recommend others! It was 1/2 mile from the pub and right at the freeway, so leaving was easy, too.	environment,food,location
Excellent Staff	service
We booked this hotel because we had a wedding. It was impeccable, comfortable, and they had an excellent breakfast.	service,facility,environment,food,location
I was at the hotel for a wedding and all of the staff, Catherine in particular, were incredibly helpful and accommodating. I also loved that there were different types of pillows on the beds!	service,facility
Stayed here for a wedding weekend. Easily accessible from the freeway, 5min drive to downtown Livermore, good weekend stay for wine tasting or weddings, not much of a view in any direction. Rooms were clean with modern decor. Parking was free. Free continental breakfast. They were remodeling the dining area during our stay but it didnt bother us too much.	facility,environment,food,location
Very nice hotel and staff, the location was also perfect because it was easy to get to due being close freeway exit.	service,location
Our family reserved 6 rooms for 2-4 days for a family event. 3 of the 6 rooms had some significant disappointments, including blood and feces on the sheets, and roaches in the room. Our daughter turned her refrigerator on upon check in and then stocked it with food. Housekeeping turned it off and the food spoiled. Gentleman at the front.	service,facility
Everything was good. The front desk staff was fine, but I thought they couldve been a more friendly and welcoming.	service
Sheets were filthy, jacuzzi was freezing with bugs in it, the breakfast had options but the eggs and bacon tasted terrible!	facility,food
Wanted to check out their wine tasting, the wine trolly was fun and affordable, the wine was great, the food downtown was good, nice atmosphere. Our Hotel was conveniently located very close to everything we wanted to do. Got some great deals at the outlets, which were close by, as well. Great weekend stay.	food,location
The pillows were way too soft without pillowcases. The mattress was so soft my back was aching. When i awoke in the am since I arrived so late and did not notice I flipped the covers off and there was dried blood on the sheets. I could not leave fast enough. Sorry but never again. The next night I stayed.	facility,environment
Clean, comfortable room. Breakfast was good. Coffee not bad. The bacon was weird. Soy maybe Kinda gross. Many people threw it away. Everything else was fine. Not over the top amazing, but I think I got my moneys worth.	environment,food
Super solid, well-maintained but nothing to write home about. Breakfast buffet, while complimentary was pretty lackluster, but a nice feature nonetheless.	food
I frequently go to Livermore for business travel and always stay at this hotel. The hotel is always clean, beds are super comfy, staff is friendly, free breakfast in the morning and wine in the evening. What else could you ask for when you are traveling	service,food
Stayed for a week - from early check-in assistance to excellent accommodations, it was all I could hope for in a multi-day business stay.	service

I expected more from a Wyndham hotel......bathroom was very small, not enough counter space for makeup bag and shaving kit. Amenities were not replenished. Had to ask for coffee replacements, then were given single serve bags for a 4 cup coffee maker! Coffee maker eventually replaced, but I had to ask... twice! And the word suite.	facility,food
My husband and I came out here from Tennessee for a business conference / couples getaway. Its our first full day here and Im already so impressed with this hotel!

We have always chosen this hotel for location and comfort, as well as value. Now with updated decor we love it even more. There was even a chaise lounge with a computer table, as well as lots of outlets for our electronics. Front staff is always helpful and polite.	service,facility
excellent service and location for wedding party. staff worked hard at accommodating numerous guests.	service
The hotel was fine, I with the shower (specifically the shower head) was cleaner, it could you a thorough scrubbing and white vinegar cleaning.	environment
We found this hotel because of its connection to the Livermore Shakespeare Festival. They offered a dinner-theater-hotel package that was perfect for our first time at this venue. The hotel is conveniently located close enough to the freeway to be easily accessible but far enough away to be out of the traffic noise. The Hawthorn staff were very pleasant.	location
My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights for a wedding in Livermore in July. I wouldnt recommend this hotel to my worst enemy.

My husband and I stayed at the Hawthorne Suites by Wyndham Livermore,CA. for my daughters wedding, as did many of their guests. It was wonderful! We got the room with 2 queen beds and they were so comfortable! I have a very bad back and they had such comfort and support. The pillows were the best pillows I had ever.	facility
I have never in my life been treated so terribly . I was kicked out of the hotel due to stained sheets and a carpet stain, was charged for every accusation and still asked to leave . I was even escorted by the police out of the hotel. This was about money. I was charged for something I didnt receive.	service,facility
Our room was on the ground floor, facing the parking lot. This meant that any time our curtains were open, we were on display for whoever was walking/driving by. It also meant we couldnt safely leave our window(s) open at night and had to rely on the very, very loud air conditioner. Although outdated, our room was very reasonable.	environment
Came to Binghamton to visit with a relative. Fair field Inn is a convenient location. Nearby is Ostinango Park which is great for walking or running.	location
Great Experience. Nice Staff clean rooms good free breakfast	service,food
Not a lot of options where I needed to stay for work, but this hotel was nice. Fairly updated and the staff was friendly. Walking distance to Cracker Barrel and Applebees, which was nice. Other restaurants within driving distance. Easy to get to, right off interstate. If I was back in town for work, Id stay here again for sure.	location
This hotel is undergoing construction. Banging and other loud noises begin early in the morning. Forget about enjoying a peaceful morning.Was very disappointed by the reaction of the hotel staff when I brought it to their attention. A free nights stay or at least a discount on my next stay may have helped the situation. Dont book this hotel until the construction is complete.	service,environment
Good Location, right off highway. Applebees next door...you can walk there! Hallway was dirty but the room was very clean and comfortable.	environment,location
The hotel was fairly new and slightly out of town. The pool was refreshing. Breakfast was adequate but as usual in hotels like this, when crowded jockeying for a spot to sit can be a challenge.	facility,food
Rooms are very small, especially for a family of 4. Beds were not very comfortable and the bathroom was also small (straddle the toilet to close the door small). The pool area was not so great. Hot tub was cloudy and the whole area had a septic smell.	facility,environment
Needs more ice machines.	facility
The staff at the Fairfield Inn were amazing. They arranged a cab for us, offered us hot tea after a late night arrival on a very cold evening, they check in on us the next day to make sure we were settled and had everything we needed. They made sure our stay at their hotel was comfortable. An extra thank you to Candice, Bea, and Donna. Thank you ladies for going above and beyond. Great breakfast in the morning too!!	service,food
Easily accessible in spite of traffic on 17. Clean. Bath a teensy bit small but still acceptable. We had a king bed - thats all they had available, but the two doubles may have been a little tight. We did use a rollaway cot for our son (510, 150lbs) and wound up putting the mattress on the floor the second night as the frame was simply too small for a teenage boy!	facility,environment
I often stay at Hampton Inns but one was not conveniently located so I opted for this Fairfield Inn near Bingham ton because it seemed to be about the same quality although a little pricier. What a mistake ! The motel, although the room was clean and comfortable, was very unattractive and way overpriced for the amenities. I would have walked out but I had a no cancellation reservation. When I mentioned the unattractiveness to the desk clerk she acknowledged the problem and very nicely explained that the place was due for a major overhaul. So. if the management knew it was not up to snuff why the high rate. This experience guarantees that I will avoid Fairfield in the future and recommend that other travelers stay away.	facility,environment,location

It was convenient a little noisy in the room with the traffic on the road (room facing the front of the building).	environment

Was hoping for a nicer room based on higher room rates than other offerings. What we found was just a plain room. Wished we had stayed somewhere else for our money. Breakfast was good value and well served.	food
We were very happy with our stay. Very nice hotel with super friendly staff. Room was clean and spacious. Had microwave, mini fridge, coffee maker. Pool area and exercise room were nice clean. Continental breakfast had lots of choices and tasted great! Loved that it was just a quick walk next door to dinner. Definitely would recommend to family friends and will absolutely stay again!	facility,environment,food
We stayed here the night before a 5k Color Run. The room was very clean - but my son did find a skittle under the bed, wedged into the corner. I think its his goal to find anything when he enters a hotel room. The beds were very comfy as were the pillows, and we were even able to enjoy the pool for a while. All in all this was a very nice hotel and the staff was great. They didnt even cringe when we walked back in after the run covered in wild colors :-)	facility,environment
Clean comfortable room with pleasant staff. No problems.	service,environment
We stayed at this property to attend an event about 20 miles away. Its close to the highway, which was convenient for us. Room was quite comfortable and had relatively new furnishings. However, upon arrival we were greeted by a large roll away bed standing on end (i.e., it blocked part of the entry and wouldnt have fit in room if it were set up). When I went to front desk to see about having it removed, I had to wait about 10 minutes for desk person who apparently was only staff person on duty and was working desk and dealing with room issues - she went with me to room to remove bed. Also, lobby was a little iffy - lobby restroom was not clean and, there was a carpet runner in the lobby that was really several pieces of leftover wall-to-wall remnants that had been hand cut - a bit tacky and a tripping hazard. Finally, a couple had a huge, screaming fight in the middle of the night, which I found quite disturbing because I was concerned it could turn violent - not hotels fault but still... Would return but probably only if there is no other option.	service,facility,environment,location

Good experience and very convenient to where I needed to be. Hotel was quiet and staff polite and helpful. Conveniently located between two restaurants that serve decent food at reasonable prices. Only downside was that hotel room was a bit dusty... not unclean but bedside lamp had dust on base. Very well out-fitted with outlets, however, which is needed these days. Overall, I was very pleased with my stay.	service,facility,environment,food,location
From the moment of check in we were pleased. Greeted cordially (not fake) we were asked if we would need anything additional (we were 6 adults and 5 children under the age of 6 renting 3 rooms). They had already put our rooms nearby (even when requested at other hotels in advance this seems to be a HUGE request and usually not done) We have stayed at other hotels in the area but your rooms are spacious and beds are wonderful. We will continue to return here anytime we are in the area.	service,facility
We were thrilled with everything from the cleanliness to the top notch breakfast to the kindness of everyone but, the very first person we met. She was the first person we approached behind the counter when we arrived. Later we learned that she was handling both the desk and the Housekeeping roles that night. If I were to judge the facility by this one person, I would have been disappointed in her lack of hospitality in answering our questions: no smile, no patience...cranky. However the rest of our stay, and we did add an extra night, more than made up for it. This was my first getaway in 4 years on ANY kind of vacation/family celebration, so I was really hoping for a good time. I really enjoyed the cleanliness, as I own a cleaning service here in MD. Thank you so much for an overall excellent stay!!!	service,facility,environment
The staff was indifferent to my stay. For example, almost had to convince the front desk to go through the effort to sell me another night stay. I almost went to another hotel because it seemed too much trouble to check me out and then check me back in. Not likely to return.	service
I had never stayed at a Fair field Inn. I was very impressed with the staff., they were excellent. The rooms were great and the service was even better. Would definitely recommend anyone looking for a hotel to stay at a Fair field Inn.	service

Hotel seemed clean. Staff was pleasant. Room seemed clean but it smelled very musty. Im not sure why it smelled that way. It would be much better if they offered rooms with 2 queen beds instead of two double beds.	service,facility,environment
We had a great stay. Have been to this hotel before. I would suggest the pool area floor be replaced though . It is very slippery!!! And I had to call the front desk for towels. Rooms are very nice ,beds very comfortable. Love that we can walk to Applebees or Cracker Barrel.	service,facility
Very comfortable. Great spread for a free breakfast buffet. The indoor pool was big enough (not huge), though the room was steamy. Friendly staff.	service,facility,environment

The hotel was easy off and on the highway, and reasonably priced, which were our main points for selection. The night clerk was very helpful for our issue. But that doesnt outweigh the huge negative of finding a condom wrapper between the sheets with suspicious spots on the blanket, which led us to believe they had not been changed from a prior guest. Upon my request, both were replaced and we were offered a different room, but inspection of this room included holes in both the sheets and blanket. Disgusting. If I hadnt booked on line I would have insisted on my money back. We would never recommend this hotel to anyone!	environment
It was just ok...room had a odor but carpet was new...just dated....i guess you get what you pay for...	facility
Well, the desk clerk Sandy was pleasant and made us feel welcome. There were no more first floor rooms, apparently, so we were stuck with climbing the stairs with our arthritis and artificial hips. Our room with two queen beds only had two sets of towels, so we had to hike back down to the desk for another set.	service,facility

We spent one night there and would stay again. The king size bedroom was clean and room had a microwave and refrigerator which was very convenient.

I attempt to use my Wyndham Rewards. He said it was invalid and created a new number for no reason. He said you can just call this number and tell them to combine the two numbers.

Terrible stay. Everything in the room felt damp as it was terribly humid. The place was dated and breakfast omelets were made in a different ZIP code or worse. The orange juice burned our throats fro the acidity. They had a cardboard like of the man in the advertisents. Now everytime I see his likeness I will run away.	facility,food
Easy and quick check-in. Room was a positive surprise, clean and spacious Pet friendly . Breakfast was basic but good good half way point from Phoenix to Milwaukee. Next trip we will stay here again.	environment,food
Overall stay was ok. The towels could have used a little more in the wash. They were dingy and you could see past stains on them. Walls had hand stains on them. Will most likely not stay here again.	facility
We stayed in the poolside room for one night and loved being in the backyard by the pool. The grounds are beautifully landscaped with trees and vines and flowers inside a privacy fence.

We would really like to give five stars to that place, because the house is really beautiful and well renovated, the garden is wonderful, peaceful, and the vegetation is great, our host was very kind and helpful and gave us a lot of advices about where to eat and what to see, the place is well located and easy to find.	service,environment
My wife and I spent our 25th wedding anniversary at this wonderful BB. Our host, Steven, was excellent and very helpful when deciding on sights and events to take in. The room was beautiful and large. The entire BB was clean and decorated for Mardi Gras. We had never been to Mobile, but after this trip.	environment
This was a perfect place to stay during our first time ever in Mobile. I would recommend a couple nights as this city has so much to offer. Great food, museums, walks along old historical areas ect. This BB is located on a main street lined with old homes and most are in great condition.	food,location
This place was really close to the area we wanted to be in. Stephen is really friendly and has great knowledge of area. However bed was extremely uncomfortable and sheets were not soft. Tub in bathroom was just really weird. Not enough room to move because of shower curtain. Didnt get to enjoy breakfast because of time we needed.	facility,food,location
This was my first time visiting Mobile, so I especially appreciated the hosts knowledge about the areas history and culture. The decor holds true to this charming homes era. I found myself walking slowly through the common areas just to take it all in. We stayed in one of the private rooms in the garden area behind the main house.	service
My husband surprised me with a trip to Mobile during Mardi Gras and we stayed at the Berney Fly. We both absolutely loved it! Its a beautiful home filled with history. Steven was amazing! Breakfast had any options you could want and Steven had many stories to keep us entertained. Id recommend staying here any time, especially if youre looking.	food
This is a GREAT place to use as a home base for exploring Mobile. Steve and Enoch know Mobile very well and can refer to all sorts of attractions, restaurants, etc. Mobile itself is just exquisite and is a fascinating place (at 300+ yearsw, its one of the oldest cities in the US) and the downtown restaurants are TERRIFIC. Of the bed and breakfasts Ive visited, Berney Fly is the closest to perfection. Steve and Enoch are wonderful and attentive hosts, the rooms are immaculate, the service is first-rate (and be sure to check out their pool in the back!). A definite must stay.	facility,food
My girlfriend and I had a really nice time at Berney Fly Bed and Breakfast. The owners were friendly and clearly in love with Mobile, offering a number of suggestions on restaurants and attractions to visit. While it was a little too cool to swim during our visit, the pool and hot tub area were very nicely maintained. Finally, breakfast.	facility,food
Altough they only have three guest rooms,it is worth trying to book one.This is not a hotel.It is an 1895 home that the owners live in.It includes a fresh made breakfast every morning and wonderful pool area.It is close to Loda and downtown hot spots for dining and drinking.Or just stay in and relax.	facility,food
We stayed in the Spanish Bay room, which was roomy and nice. The proprietors are friendly and talkative. Steve made sure we had suggestions on places to go and eat while we were there. I really enjoyed the breakfasts. Not overly elaborate, but with the small number of guests, you wouldnt expect it to be. The pool area in the back.	service,facility,food
We stayed here for one night during our road trip across the US. Steven was friendly and hospitable and the room was large and clean. Breakfast the next morning was delicious and plentiful. Make sure you walk around the neighbourhood during the day, there are some beautiful mansions. I highly recommend staying here if you are coming to Mobile!	environment,food
This is absolutely a Southern Gem,... I have been given a tour of this House prior to the Annex, and enjoyed the Pool on a Day Pass... The Host couldnt be better. Folks need to Remember they are practically staying in a Museum on Govt Blvd with Age old OAK rees n a Piece of History plumbing was integrated after.	facility
Had a very nice stay here, everything was perfect! We were greeted upon arrival and given a history of the home and local area. The home is in very nice condition, and nicely decorated. We stayed in the pool cottage at the back of the property, which was more private. The pool is nice and refreshing, the back yard nicely.	facility
We enjoyed our one night stay in the Berney Fly BB. We stayed in the Spanish Bay Deluxe Room. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet. The innkeeper was very helpful and knowledgeable. His recommendations for restaurants and things to do were spot on. He related some interesting facts and information about the inn. Our breakfast was really good.	service,environment,food
We stayed at Berney Fly Bed and Breakfast last week and had a wonderful time! Our room was comfortable, clean and unique. Breakfast was wonderful and the pool was amazing.

Nice place in a neighborhood filled with great old houses/mansions. Friendly inn keeper with lots of information. Clean room. We stayed in the French Deco room for one night. Quiet street. Not far from downtown (5 min drives). Tasty breakfast. Thanks, Berney Fly!	service,food
We had an extremely comfortable night here, the house itself is beautifully looked after, the room was plush with an en-suite with everything you could need during your stay. Stephen was incredibly knowledgeable about the area, Mardi Gras which he is obviously very involved with and the history of the property. He directed us to a great bar.	service,environment
While seeking accommodations for our complex family group, (ages 25 to 96), Innkeeper Steven was creative, thoughtful and put in extra effort to solve out housing needs. He responded to our multiple inquiries quickly with solutions as well as with reasonable rates. Thank you innkeeper Steven!	service
If you are travelling the Southern States, travelling lets say from Florida to Texas, or even further, I highly recommend you have a break at this place. Better than the standard hotel rooms we all know to well. We stayed at Berney Fly Bed and Breakfast about 2 weeks ago, for 2 nights, and had a great time.	food
Located in a beautiful area of Mobile, in the historical district, the house has big porches with chairs to sit, nice gardens, and is lovely inside. Stephen can give you a verbal historical tour of the property and the town of Mobil, and he made every effort to make us comfortable. Rooms are exceptionally large.	service,facility

Steve and Enoch are wonderful and attentive hosts, the rooms are immaculate, the service is first-rate (and be sure to check out their pool in the back!). A definite must stay.	facility,food,location
The rooms are charming, the host is knowledgeable , and the breakfast is excellent. I spent two nights and felt completely welcomed in a calming atmosphere. Steve also gave me easy directions to my worksite!!!	service,environment,food
Loved the back yard with the pool and Jacuzzi Beautiful antiques and knicks knack. Enjoyed the breakfast. Steve was available to answer any question that we had. Good value. We spent only one evening, but wished we had stayed two.	service,facility,food
The service and the food was above average. The room was clean and quiet, but dated. A excellent location in a charming neighborhood. A beautiful new swimming pool and spa, made a charming yard. It is a big house that needs work, but we enjoyed our stay.	service,facility,environment,food
This is a lovely B and B with helpful, friendly staff who love Mobile. Its located in the Oakleigh Gardens District near excellent restaurants. The 1895 home is beautifully decorated in period furnishings and it has a lovely pool for a cool down swim. We enjoyed walking the Oakleigh district and visited the Oakleigh Mansion built in 1833.	service,facility,location
The home is full of delightful antiques and knick-knacks - each one with its own history. We were visiting our sons fiancee who has been teaching in Mobile while she finished her masters degree in education. Breakfast both mornings was delicious with fresh fruit, scrambled eggs plus, coffee and juice both days, biscuits morning and banana pancakes the other.	environment,food
Berney-Fly is a nice BB. The location is good with easy access to all points in Mobile. Steve, the operator, is welcoming. Steve admits that much of the house is due for a makeover. But it is quite comfortable with large rooms and decent furniture and fixtures. My biggest complaint is that the clawfoot tub/shower is difficult to get in.	service,facility,location
Myself partner Michelle stayed one night on our trip around the Southern States. What can I say about the Berney Fly, well its just how I would expect a local guest house to be, traditional architecture wonderful rooms including our bedroom. Its like going back in time but with all the Modern facilities like wifi lol.	facility,environment
great swimming pool and sub-tropical gardens read more	facility
If you are looking for a romantic spot in Mobile, this is it! This lovely home is located on a shady street lined with live oaks in a historic district of Mobile. There are several good restaurants within walking distance, and the host will be glad to tell you about them, as well as give you ideas for things.	service,environment,location
My husband and I visited Berney Fly for our 25th anniversary and will definitely be back! Steven was a fantastic host and an excellent cook! Even though I neglected to tell him in advance of my food restrictions, he did his very best to accommodate me and provided wonderfully tasty breakfasts. We stayed in the room on the bottom floor.	service,food

My wife and I went to a concert at The Saenger Theater. It was very close and the stay was all around wonderful! Beautiful house, pool, room, it was quiet, delicious breakfast, fabulous service, and we met some great people too. Conversation with Steve (innkeeper) is intelligent as well. Ty Steve! We will be back!	service,facility,food,location
We spent part of our honeymoon trip here, and we loved it. The house is astonishingly beautiful and Steven prepared us an amazing breakfast everyday, gave us great advice on where to go and what to see and was in general a perfect innkeeper! Thanks again!!!	environment,food
When we had booked this hotel we had emailed in advanced asking if we could store out luggage while we went camping, they seemed to have no problem with this, until we arrived. When we asked where we would keep our bags the lady insisted we must have been confused even after we had shown her the email stating we.	facility
Positives: Location! It is on the main strip, next to Hard Rock Cafe and lots of food options. Walking distance to Waikiki Beach and The Cheesecake Factory. Room size is decent. Negatives: In major need of a renovation! Very outdated and the lifts smell. Wifi connection is poor. Overall, would stay here again.	facility,environment,location
We spent 2 weeks in this hotel due to the cost of the the normal hotels we stay at were double the normal cost. The location of this hotel is GREAT, it has a nice good size flat screen TV with cable/Sat TV, and both beds were actually pretty comfortable - at this poit there is nothing else.	facility,location
I hesitate to share negative experience on the internet, but for the sake of others who could make the same mistake as us I feel obligated to. This hotel is a total sham. We do not live in Waikiki and like most travelers must make reservations at hotels based upon hotel websites and reviews. Their website inaccurately advertised clean updated.	environment
The staff were really friendly and very accommodating. If you are looking for somewhere to stay for the value of your money (esp. if you are on a budget) then its PolyPlaza. Its got FREE wifi, a kitchenette (fridge, microwave and cofee-maker and eating utensils, plates and cups). The housemaids will provide Hawaiian coffee everyday and housekeeping. The bathroom is good.	service,facility,food
Clean room, old style, 1960ish, needs some renovations, but again, location, location, location! !! Near, beach, shopping, restaurants, and, bus, very convenient! !Great, place, to stay, if you dont mind having big hotel luxury, but your in Hawaii, so youll be out everyday, enjoying, so save money and stay here, Aloha! !!!!!!!!	environment,location
We stayed here for about a week in October 2015. We checked in with no problems and were given a key that would allow us to use the elevator and access the stairs. The elevator is a little bit sketchy but we never really used it (only for when we arrived with all the luggage and for when we left).	facility
We stayed here for over a month as we have just moved to Honolulu and had to sort a permanent place to stay. The Manager and Staff were very friendly and went out of their way to make sure they had a room for us and worked with us during our stay - as we didnt know when we would.	service
Hey, if you want a Hilton or even a Holiday Inn this may not be for you but if you want Waikiki on a hometown beach budget its a winner! Tucked in behind the big towers on the beach the reach the sky in altitude and price is Polynesian Plaza. An older place but comfy like your favorite couch.	location
I booked this hotel for mid October months ago. In early October, I called this hotel to find out more about the bathroom size and to my horror, the hotel just cancelled my reservations without informing me. Can you imagine if I had arrived on that day with 2 children to only find out I have no where to stay.	service,facility
For the price that I paid for the room, it was horrific meaning that when me and my wife got into the room, IT WAS VERY HOT! The next thing was that the elevator wasnt working, it took us over 45 minutes to find out that the hotel didnt have a parking spot after making circles and finally, the shower.	service,facility,environment
Rooms were nice, basic but a good size, older style. No mod cons. The beds were very comfortable. Good size kitchenette. Great location. Nice pool. Wifi was only free down in common area which was pretty much completely outside so not fun when raining. And it wasnt the best wifi. Better to go to Starbucks. There was wifi available.	facility,environment
This is an older property but it is super clean, never saw a bug anywhere! It is the best location-in my opinion-with everything from awesome dining to 3 blocks walk to public beach (with beachside drinks/snack shack). Love the 5-6 food truck court just one block away on Beachwalk Ave. Amazing shopping (Prada, Coach, Louis Vitton, etc.).	environment,location
The entrance to the hotel is low key and between two retail stores on busy the Kalakaua Avenue. You could easily pass by its entrance on the street and miss it. Their Waikiki location is very good for shopping and access to TheBus. If you know what you want to visit on Oahu, I strongly recommend using the economical.	location
The only reason for the 4th star is the location and staff. The hotel is located 10 minutes from the beach, opposite Tiffanys/Coach/Burberry and right downstairs is an amazing ramen restaurant. It is walking distance to all the necessary amenities. Its quite hidden, walked past several times and had to double back. Also safe at night.	service,location
Great location but subpar accommodations.	environment,location
I knew this wasnt going to be amazing simply because of the price and previous reviews. It wasnt horrible but it doesnt look like the website at all..... Like at all. Its livable and the location is great. You can get parking really close for 24 a day. The wifi doesnt work the top two floors are under construction.	facility,location
Not exactly a five-star hotel but right in the heart of the Waikiki shopping precinct and a fairly short walk to the beach. Surrounded by high-end shops and restaurants, the accommodation is basic but you will money left over for shopping and sightseeing. An ABC convenience store across the road which sells food, clothing and booze. Get a unit fronting.	location
Unprepared for firstly the unwelcoming entrance to this establishment. Up a narrow walkway, past a lift that reminded me of the ancient ones in Paris To find the Office a room out by the pool area with 3/4 of the window area covered with glass like banks used to have. We had to bend down to talk.	facility
Most may not like a tired appearance, but the place was clean, provided cooking facilities, WiFi, a very comfortable queen bed. Would be one of the cheapest hotels amongst a lot of 5 stars hotels at a fraction of cost.	facility,environment
We had a one night stay at your hotel, Sept. 19. 2015. It had to be the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Upon arrival we discovered that the elevator was broken. I was traveling with an elderly gentleman and the stairs were the only way to our room. Due to time constraints and our one night stay in.	facility
Very nice hotel with very nice atmosphere. Definitely something Id recommend. The interior was renovated probably 10 years ago, so its not brand new, but its clean and comfortable. The Hotel CEO and the manager on duty took their time to talk to all guests one evening and ask about our stay etc. over a glass of champagne (free of charge). Ive never seen such good service at a hotel. I should mention the spa and pool - very good bonus. If I had to say something negative - the internet connection. Its simply criminal to have such a slow and unstable internet connection in 2015. And may be, king size beds that are not to single beds with tendency to move apart.	service,facility,environment
An experience for life. Just do it! Staff did their utmost to make our stay perfect, and perfect it was. Location is absolutely beautiful and secluded. Rooms and entire estate is very charming. Especially enjoyed taking the boats out on the lake. Hope to return some time in the future.	service,location
We were picked up from the airport in a car which was not vacuum cleaned for a long time. That might sound like a small thing, but it is symbolic for the rest of our experience. Just not good enough anymore, except the bill. Running a place like this is like being married to a Harvard educated supermodel. Its high.	environment
On the shore of Lake Saranac, this is a very luxurious and peaceful place to stay. The food was high quality, and the service was perfect. Nothing is too much trouble. Lunch can be wherever you want it - a picnic on a small island, on the deck, in your room..... Breakfast is when and where you want it.	food,location
From the minute you arrive until the minute you sadly have to leave The Point, you are treated as if your person needs and desires are the only thing that matter. The staff and service here are incomparable to most any place else you will ever stay. The setting is glorious, with great views of the lake and woods.	service,environment
The point is possibly one of our favorite restaurants . With our children all over the age of 21 its fun to go Out and enjoy a great meal snd casual drinks eith our children. I have never have been disappointed with any thing I have ordered there to eat, and the orange crushes are amazing.	food
The Point exceeds perfection. From the moment you arrive be prepared to indulge. The grounds and accommodations are very charming and comfy. Besides all the dead animals on the walls. Im a city girl and that took me a bit to get used to and settle into this mountainous element. Its a 5 star sleep away camp for adults.	facility
That is the name on one of their boats. And the essence of their philosophy. They have gotten the point and do everything right. From the warmest and crunchiest breakfast croissant to a lit fireplace and hot tea in the cabin to greet you after your hike.And every single person will do their outmost to keep you happy.	food
We visited The Point two years ago, and decided to return for our 25th Wedding Anniversary. I was a little apprehensive - so often when you loved somewhere first time the return is a disappointment and we had such an amazing time - would this visit be as good We arrived by car to be greeted warmly by staff.	service
The only place ill stay in Houston. Fantastic service, incredibly friendly staff, great food and the best fitness options in the entire city. The rooms are a bit small and bathrooms are not luxurious by todays standards, but they are more than adequate and everything else about the place more than makes up for any shortcomings in that department.	service,food
The room smelled as soon as you walked in. Smelled very humid.	environment
Loved everything about the Houstoinan from the very attentive car valets to the door greeter. My only complaint concerns the bed pillows. Unfortunately they were very thin flimsy! Loved the pool area gym too!	facility
Stayed one night to attend a meeting held the next day. Dined at in-house restaurant, The Olivette, where the wine list and the meal were excellent and the service was very good. The attractively decorated rooms are very quiet with a forest view out the windows. It is hard to imagine you are in the middle of a major city here. The room was very clean and there was nice turndown service. The room was adequately lighted and there were outlets to charge electronics. There were nice pillows on the bed and the linens were crisp and new-looking. Check in and Check Out were a breeze. The front desk verified my expenses and gave me a print out of my charges.	facility,environment,food
Really enjoyed the spa. Great facial!	facility

Excellent service, beautiful Christmas decor, wonderful time at the Trellis Spa.	service,facility,environment
Met up with our daughter and had a great time in Houston. The hotel was easy to find and was quite lovely--especially the spa!! Would highly recommend taking time to use the Trellis Spa while in Houston.	facility,location
Everyone at the hotel made our stay so amazing. We were there in time to see the harvest decorations being put away and the magnificent Christmas decor being put up. They all did an amazing job. It is definitely more for couples and grown ups. It would feel too stuffy for children.	environment
We have been staying at the Houstonian hotel for 20 years now and its never let us down!!! When the staff calls us by our names year after year.... What does that tell u about the hotel management.	service
Hotel was awesome. Service was beyond anything Ive gotten before. Room service and food was EXCELLENT.	service,food
Great place to enjoy relaxing family time. 3 pools! Several restaurants and very friendly staff.	service,facility
Hotel and hotel staff are amazing, 5 stars. Family pool was awful, our neighborhood pool is 100xs cleaner, better service personnel and life guards that enjoy their job. Great get away for couples or business, leave family at home.	service
25th anniv mini getaway. Secluded yet in the Uptown area, great, restrained service.	service
We live on the other side of Houston and felt that our stay at the Houstonian was a wonderful getaway. It really felt like we were on holiday. We loved the comfort, the view of the woods and the tranquility of the place.	environment
Great stay as always. Superior accommodations, food, fitness classes(31/day)with excellent instructors, grounds, swimming pools. The best in Houston by far.	facility,food
The most relaxing beautiful hotel in Houston. Service is exceptional and staff is excellent. Spa is the best inTexas....	facility,environment,food
The hotel was nice but is very outdated. The bathroom for a family for very, very small. We had a deluxe king room which is good for 4 people but the bathroom was the size fit for a standard room for 2 people.	facility
Wonderful stay! Great couples retreat. Make sure you stay a couple of days to take advantage of all of the amenities including the Trellis Spa. Will definitely be back for our anniversary. Staff is superb and dont forget to eat at the restaurant downstairs Olivette.	service,facility,location
The Houstonian may not be the cheapest hotel in the area, but I believe its the best. Its still a great value when you look at the service, amenities, and location. The grounds make it a wonderful oasis in a busy part of the city. Everything is kept up immaculately and is first class. The rooms have everything you could need for a comfortable stay. I loved walking the beautiful and easy to walk path around the grounds each morning and seeing/hearing all the birds. I didnt use the pool areas, but they are gorgeous and spacious. Highly recommended hotel.	facility,environment
We always have a pleasant stay at the Houstonian, love the atmosphere, the rooms are also dark in the morning due to the lush greenery so we are able to get a good nights rest. We were celebrating our triplet grandchildrens 6th Birthday (their favorite hotel) and they were surprised by the hotel with a plate of fresh cookies and milk! Thank you Houstonian!	environment,food
I checked in for 10 days, but checked out after 2. My problem with the hotel was room size - particularly bathroom size. The bedroom was adequate. The bathroom ceiling is at about 6.5 feet. The door opens into the tiny bathroom which makes it necessary to close the door making it extremely claustrophobic.	facility
The king size bed was the most uncomfortable bed I had slept in for decades. I honestly thought I was sleeping on a sheet of plywood.	facility
This hotel is way over rated, its nothing like the description or the reviews. Basically its Old (very old) building in the heart of apartment complex/parking lot jungle. Furniture is very old, hotel theme feel like 1850s, clean but old. Tge staff is friendly but you can tell they inexperienced , mostly in there 20s. Room it self spacious but old, old carpet and TV. Bathrooms similar to Motels, bedsheets clean, new sheets, but bed is saggy. Surrounding area is jungle, literally!! Misty and not well kept. Lots traffic once you leave parking. Ppl come from surrounding complex apartments to run on trail. Bottom line, money wasted, will never come again.	facility,environment
Staff were awesome. By 2 nd day knew our name and were so nice. Will definitely go there again.	service
Nice hotel, secluded so that you dont feel like youre in the city but convenient for business great exercise facilities for working out. swimming and tennis.	facility
Great resort facilities, several pools, including a lap pool and an enormous gym. Room was very comfortable. We went for the concierge package, which included complementary drinks, snacks and continental breakfast. Lovely.	facility,food
We stop at the Houstonian every year on our way to ski and my 2 teenage boys just love it. We love the location, the food and the workout facilities. My kids especially love the basketball court!	facility,food,location
Hotel is very nice. High end finishes. Friendly staff. Bed was comfortable. There was some noise both from other guests and maintenance of grounds. Amenities are exceptional. Food in restaurants was also very good.	service,environment,food

So relaxing and nice atmosphere. I took my pregnant girlfriend here as a last minute getaway in our hometown before her 3rd child arrived... we relaxed, rested, and enjoy the quite. The spa serices near by were on point...	facility,environment
Room and bathroom were extremely small considering the amount we paid per night to stay.	facility
We have stayed at the Houstonian before and its always top notch. Their holiday decor is amazing, and the staff is always so helpful.	service
We were in Houston for a family event so several families were staying at the Houstonian. We took advantage of the bar for nightcaps and the large fireplace and comfy sitting area off the lobby for complimentary coffee and conversation.	facility
Great hotel! The pools were amazing. We will be staying here anytime we go to Houston.	facility
Been staying there for 25 years. Great food, great gym, grounds amazing, staff super. Enough said!	service,facility,food
5 star accommodations as well as service. Even during the floods- they had staff to help us. We LOVED our time there.	service
Combination business and family. Really liked the exercise facility and service all around.	facility
My husband and I took a stacation here and it indeed is a five star from the amazing service to all the updated amenities, pools, gym everything was almost perfect. We chose this hotel after I verified that their shuttle went within 3 miles also viewing this on their website. Well time to take off and there was  no shuttle  available on Sunday after 6pm which I could not verify. That put a twist on things, we drove around the corner anyhow.	service,facility,location
We stayed a couple of nights for our daughters bday and Fathers day weekend for me as well. Everything was topnotch! From the courteous staff and great service down to every little detail. Our rooms were clean and well kept as well as all the public spaces. Our room had a nice view that seemed like we were in the woods. Indoor basketball and tennis court as well outdoor tennis courts just to name a few. Even has a lap pool (not sure if it was olympic size though). All gears and equipment are provided free of charge so no need to bring racquets, balls and even shoes. Just make sure to wear or bring socks but worry not as they sell socks if you happen to forget. We all enjoyed our stay. From my wife getting pampered inside their spa for most of the time to me and our teenage kids working a lot of sweat playing all sorts of sports. The only thing that was somewhat awkward for us was that their recreational pool was filled wth mostly small kids and toddlers with their Soccer Moms or the Rich Wives of Beverly hills type of women. Not really encouraging for a full grown man who likes to drink his cold beer by the pool or teenage kids/young adults doing their horsing around or whatever. Their lap pool is always occupied and Waiting a while for a lane to be vacant somewhat takes the fun out of it. Over all, Its a magnificent place to stay with so many things to enjoy while youre at it. And as my title says, Its a Country Club with a little touch of Hotel!	facility
We stayed at The Houstonian to celebrate our 17th Wedding Anniversary and are so glad we chose this hotel. There were a few hiccups in our stay, but we had such a nice time that the things that did go wrong are forgiven. The staff did try their best to makeup for the mishaps, which shows that they do care about their guests. I will say the bathrooms are very small (when you open the door there is only about 5 inches from the door to the toilet). The vanity and mirror is spacious, but definitely not for 2 people at once. The Trellis Spa and service from its staff is impeccable, and the gym and outdoor amenities makeup for the age of the hotel. It is hidden away from the busy roads and noise of the surrounding area, so you really feel like you are able to relax as if you were somewhere far away. The views out the windows all around the hotel are views of beautiful tress, as if you were in a secluded rainforest. As other reviewers mentioned, the valet service was really top notch and on their game. We will definitely be returning for a staycation at The Houstonian again. Thank you for making it a memorable Anniversary!	service,facility,environment
We came in for wedding. The staff was exceptional. Loved the workout facility. Will definitely stay again next time we are in Houston.	service
The Hotel and its grounds are beautiful, to say the least. Very warm, very welcoming, very grand. The staff were incredibly professional and welcoming as well. Everyone from the front desk to the spa to the bar - same level of amazing service. Speaking of the spa - I have never had a spa experience like this. Unbelievable! The ultimate in luxury in relaxation. Due to the flooding in the area we left a night early, just to be on the safe side. They did not charge us the extra night. I am seriously looking for excuses to stay at this hotel again.	service,environment
What a fabulous hotel and resort property . Incredible amenities made our family time relaxing and enjoyable, providing us with the perfect getaway escape and memories !!	facility
This is a beautiful hotel with great views and excellent amenities. The Spa staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel front desk staff are not as friendly, yet they are professional. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a luxurious weekend getaway.	service,facility,environment
The valets here are awesome. They greet you with a smile and a sense of urgency to help. They provide cold bottles of water each time you leave. While it may look like this hotel is off the beaten path, I assure you that it is easy to get to and really gets you out of the fray of the Galleria traffic without leaving the neighborhood.	service,location
We had a great time there- beautiful place with wonderful staff. Would love to go again.	service
The hotel room was a lotttt smaller than I thought it would be. We ordered room service and there was a hair in the crab cake! Then it took an hour for us to get any kind of manager or staff member to actually help us. Once we finally talked to someone that could help, Kevin, he was extremely short and unpleasant. When we came down for dinner at the restaurant he didnt address us but talked to every other table around us. Hotel was nice, amenities even nicer but I was disappointed at the services especially given how expensive everything is!	service,facility
Excellent hotel - service was beyond anything we have experienced. I would recommend this hotel to everyone looking for a place to stay in Houston. Location is tremendous and the surrounding area is beautiful!	service,location
Beautiful hotel, but very intimidating!! Hard to figure out where the pools were.	facility,environment
My wife and I stayed at the Houstonian for 3 nights in October. The property was lovely and the room was very comfortable. However the fitness facilities are truly amazing. The property is connected to the Houstonian Club which is a separate sports club that has truly world class facilities. It has 3 pools (a massive lap pool, resort pool and other small quiet pool), the largest gym I have seen anywhere, basketball and tennis courts, a jogging track and at least 5 studios for classes. My wife has been a regular (5 times a week) gym user for over 16 years and she has been a member of many gyms in NYC and London and this is by far the best she has experienced. She went to 3 classes and the studios, instructors and equipment could not have been better. Further there is no need to register for any class you just turn up and participate. In the luxurious locker rooms there is free coffee, tea, ice tea, water etc... We also ate at the bar and Olivette restaurant and the food and service were excellent. My wife also visited the spa and although it was expensive the facilities and service were again of the highest quality.	facility,food
We can to town for a college football game and we a little nervous about the room size some complained about, but found it acceptable. The property is beautiful and the staff was a friendly and helpful as it gets. We will stay here again when we retuen to Houston.	service,environment
It was like a resort in the middle of Houston. The spa, fitness center and pools were a nice touch that enabled us to stay here and be entertained at the same time. Very nice!	facility

Beautiful hotel at a great value! Amazed at what we paid for a room on the concierge floor that included free daily continental breakfast, early evening cocktails and hors doeuvres, and after dinner dessert buffet. The Olivette restaurant was spectacular - had dinner there both nights. Will definitely be my go-to hotel any time Im in Houston!	environment,food
My family and I like to vist spokane we went on priceline and found that this was the cheapest and it had a indoor pool and and gym We were very pleased the room is clean, smells clean with friendly people and pet friendly.

I asked for a nonsmoking room and was pleased with the fact that it didnt seem like other people were smoking, so thats good. You get a 7 breakfast credit for the restaurant which was cool, although I think I prefer traditional continental breakfasts that are buffet style. The wifi was fast, so that was good. I didnt use the pool/hot tub/gym BUT it looked clean and ready to use. The staff was very friendly and helpful.	service,facility,food
I always stay at this hotel when visiting my mother who lives in Madison, Me. Always very pleasant and cordial staff.	service
We stayed one night on a family visit to my daughters camp. It was easy to reach, easy to find and perfect for a short stay. The pool is very large, but almost too warm, and the hot tub is uninviting. Wed just come from a Hilton Garden Inn, which is a very good step up, so a comparison to the Waterville Grand Hotel is a bit loaded. We stayed at the Comfort Inn last year, and Ill just say we were determined NOT to stay there again. Id go back to the Best Western, but Id suggest you drop the "grand" from the name.	facility,environment
Great service, comfortable hotel. Rug was wet in our room by the window. Otherwise, a super hotel - and a great breakfast!	food

We had 3 of us and they had no queen rooms available!! Beds were small! Breakfast was not included as written! Breakfast was a $14. Voucher and for only 2 people, not 3! So, we did not use it at all! Went elsewhere to eat! Also, when Maid service came in room to make beds and such ... They didnt leave fresh towels or new coffee packets!	facility,food
If you need an elevator this is not the place to go. It is in a strange place. The breakfast was not at all to rave about. Muffins, scrambled eggs cold cereal, juice. We didnt use the pool, no time for that.	facility,food
The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. After 10 days they felt like family. The restaurant is very good as well. Was happy that my room had a refrigerator and a nice little view of the courtyard. My only hope for my next stay would be better cleaning/upkeep of the air conditioning/heating unit. I suffered awful upper respiratory symptoms when the unit was in use. Im guessing the filters need to be cleaned and/or replaced more frequently.	service,food
I am a 75yr old Disabled Vet and had requested 2 bed room on first floor as I have walking disability from service. First thing get sent to 2nd floor King. Nobody even read reservation.

I always stay at this hotel when visiting my mother who lives in Madison, Me. Always very pleasant and cordial staff.	service
Hotel was very clean and staff very nice. Beds are only double instead of Queen which makes traveling with two teenage boys not easy. Ordered a cot but really no room to set up had to block bathroom. Great for a two person stay, also free breakfast was for only two people, so had to pay for kids.	service,facility,environment,food
This is my second stay recently. Rooms are decent but you can forget about the amenities they advertise. The pool is nice, but good luck finding a towel or staff person. Its not easy to get the complimentary breakfast.......you need to know the secret handshake then be prepared to wait an hour for a server and even more for the meal to cook. If you try to have breakfast there take a look around the restaurant and see how many table have food.......or more likely you will see empty tables with angry/hungry customers and 1 server trying to keep everyone happy.Its a decent hotel that does not hire enough staff to maintain the amenities. I feel bad for the employees of this hotel.......they are very pleasant but obviously over worked. This hotel is good if you need a place to crash but that is about it. I will try a different hotel when I am in Waterville again.	service,facility,environment,food

They should clean the rugs around the elevators, The room was very clean.	facility,environment
Free breakfast was great dinner not so much. I dont know why I thought sweet potato encrusted haddock sounded good. They also buried it in a white gravy. Gravy does not belong on fish.	food
Hotel was clean and room size was fine. Mini fridge and microwave in room were a plus. Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment. Restaurant food was good (we got a 14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost 20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there. Overall this was a decent hotel and much better than what others in our group experienced at competitors in the area.	service,facility,environment
The hotel was very clean, comfortable, and accommodating to the fact that we had a dog. However the restaurant that is attached to the hotel is what they use for the included breakfast, which has the poorest customer service and rudest employees Ive encountered in a while.	environment,location
Its a decent hotel for the price. They provide a solid breakfast, and the rooms are really nice. The only problem is their wifi is spotty if youre in the back of the building.	facility,food
Stayed overnight for pleasure. Room was clean and well equipped. Pool was great.	facility,environment
I just ran up to the middle of Maine for a one day business trip. All the people that I had interacted with were very nice, from the people at the hotel to the business staff and owner, and all the people at the various restaurants we ate at. This hotel is dog friendly which was the main reason.	service
Rooms have been updated and are very nice.  Pool was a huge hit with our grandchildren but needs an "intensive" cleaning.  They host birthday parties and it would be good if they posted times because it gets way too crazy to enjoy when that many kids are there.	facility,environment
It was very good, but the closet area was not even wide enough for the coat hangers, could not open and shut doors with hangers hanging up.	facility
A good value. Remodeling, room was very comfortable. Lots of food and shopping available within walking distance.Good option for children, has pool.	environment,location
We booked a one night stay at the Best Western on a trip to Maine. The was located right at the exit off Route 95. The check inn staff were pleasant and informative. Our room was large, clean and comfortable. It included a refrigerator and microwave as well as a small coffee brewer with the fixings.	environment
We did not realize it is a dog friendly hotel and there were lots of dogs, including a yappy one right next to us. But I called the front desk and they took care of it. I am allergic to dogs but did not have any problem in our room. The breakfast service was horribly slow, both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food. Who wants to wait for coffee I finally got my own out in the hallway. . . . Our last morning we just skipped breakfast because we didnt want to wait.	service,food
Room was not clean. We didnt feel comfortable. Cigarette burns in comforter.	environment
The hotel was comfortable.  It appeared to be popular with workers and truckers. Families appeared to like the indoor swimming pool, which I did not use. The restaurant appeared to be a place where contractors went.	facility

While I wouldnt choose the spot for a long term stay, its location was perfect for an on-the-way hotel, right on the Interstate. Loved the massive room and comfortable bed.	facility,location
The door to the room was broken and did not shut properly.2. WiFi frequently stopped working and the staff would not help and told us that we had to work it out with the IT tech from some other company.I would expect the hotel to take care of this.3. We payed for 3 people but they said they would only provide breakfast for 2. I had an unpleasant haggle with the management to finally work this out.	facility,food
Rooms were comfortable and clean and the staff was very peasant, great stay for the price. Had dinner one night in the restaurant which wasnt very good but there are some local pubs in the area which were very good. Breakfast in the restaurant was good. Overall the stay was a good value.Dear williamtO4368AZ - Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel! Were glad you enjoyed your stay, and we will be sure to pass your comments along to the staff at OBriens Restaurant :) We hope youll stay with us again on our next trip to the Waterville area!	service,environment,food
There was someone elses stuff left in our washroom.  The person at the counter was snotty when she saw that I had reserved online.	facility
Fast friendly service by all staff.  Could tell rooms were renovated and clean and comfortable, pool area was a little tired with age but functional.	service,environment
The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. The room and facility was spotless. The restaurant was terrible. I made the mistake of ordering one of the specials, prime rib. It was without a doubt the worst prime rib I have ever eaten or should I say tried to eat. Our server asked how it was so I told.	service,food
Clean room, comfortable beds, lots of pillows. My only complaint is the continental breakfast. Cold cereal, coffee, tea, OJ, toast and muffins. No fresh fruit or yogurt. They offer a full menu, but you pay for it.	facility,environment,food
The staff was fantastic. Nice room. Could have used more than 2 bath towels. It was a little noisy in the morning... I think it had to do with the washing machine... sounded like a loud helicopter. I was a little disappointed when I went to swim in the morning that there was a senior exercise class going on using the entire pool and only a single lap aisle so no room for me to take a swim. It was a good stay and I would stay there again.	service,facility
i had a great time nice hotel, friendly staff and clean room.	service,environment
Hotel Great Staff Very friendly and helpful. Room very clean overall A rating.	service,environment
Slightly tired hotel, but probably the best hotel in Waterville. Skip the in-house breakfast voucher & eat at Governors or Starbucks across the street.	food
Arrived late (10:00 pm). Called ahead to give heads up of late arrival. When we arrived to check in, no one was at front desk. No sign. No human being. Nothing. Waited 15 minutes. Finally front desk person returned. Apologized. Said she had to change someones sheets. Gross! Hotel was worn/shabby. Only plus was breakfast (included). Table service. Service was good. Food was good.	service,facility,food
Great stay. friendly front desk staff. Breakfast in the restaurant was great but dinner was blah. Only issue with the room was the dust pilled up on the shelf where the towels are kept in the bathroom. Other then that I would stay here again.	service,facility,food
Need more staff in restraunt on busy weekend. Sat. morning breakfast a disaster. Long wait, wrong order. Otherwise a very good stay. And much better than in past years.	service,food
It feels unfair to complain about the amenities as the hotel was under renovations. However, I was extremely disappointed that the pool was closed for renovations. I was happy to see a brand new bed in our room, and the bathroom looked very nice. Until you pulled back the shower curtain. The same old bathtub. Very friendly staff, VERY convenient location. The kitchen lost our room service order, but did take six dollars off the bill. So I would recommend this hotel to others, but I would tell them to wait a while until they get the renos done and sort out a few issues.	service,facility
Hotel smelled musty and had to move rooms water in shower would not turn off did not fell or smell clear either room would not stay again.	facility,environment
This hotel was being remodled and should not have been renting rooms on the second floor where we were assigned,it was a total shambles including large holes in the curtains and debris laying everywhere. How could they expect anyone to stay in that kind of environment. We looked at the room and left and rented another hotel, we had already signed in and were werelocked into the contrac with our prebooking through expedia. We are disappointed with expedia on this one.	environment
The hotel was fine, just know that smoking is allowed on some floors so there is lingering tobacco odor in some corridors. OBriens was a nice surprise, good food and great service. Also, a true breakfast is included with the price of the room, cooked to order not the typical complimentary breakfast buffet. The internet speed was good as well.	facility,food
The hotel itself was quiet, and the location was easy to find but could use some updates.  I went to use the gym and two out of the three treadmills were broken.  The room was also beside the pool making it very humid and uncomfortable.  The shower located in my room leaked all over the bathroom floor.	facility,environment
The inside of the Hotel is old and it smells. The elevators had a n harsh smell of oil. When I reserved my room through Hotels.com it mentioned "Free Breakfast" - what a joke. Its a voucher (1 person is allowed $7 off a breakfast of the menu, and $14 total off for 2 or more people at the restaurant. Its really false publicity! I will not be staying at that hotel again. Bathroom in the room was not cleaned. Mirrors were dirty. Its like the rooms were done in a hurry! Roll away bed was pushed in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket. The reservation was for 3. Just a set of 2 towels. We had the heat full blast, and we froze in the middle of the night. Very poor managed!	facility,food
traveling with just myself and 2 small kids and the staff was helpful and kind,the food in the rest. was great and affordable.	service,food
the hotel was great , clean etc. but that one desk lady was like not to helpful - and the business center is a desk next to the hotel desk and the computer didnt have Microsoft installed and that one desk lady is totally computer unaware and could not do anything to help with the business center malfunctions - except to say. yes, those computers didnt work right and that she knew you couldnt open any attachments and that staples was across the street.	service,environment
nice experience, breakfast the first day was questionable, but we tried the next day and was pleased.	food
Very nice room.loved the pool. Could have been lower in price but would stay there again.	facility
No coffee in lobby, front desk suggested I but some at the hotel restaurant. Parking lot was icy and not plowed, even after several complaints. Did not comply with Platinum Status rules. Reservations didnt match room location. Front desk staff was not knowledgeable. Room was nice.	service,facility
All the hallways smell of smoke. The room was dirty when we checked in. The next day they never sent housekeeping to clean. Did not give us clean towels in spite of the request for those and housekeeping services. They said the housekeepers had all gone home. The restaurant was terrible service. One person waiting on the room over breakfast the first day. Twenty minutes to receive a menu and then nothing after the meal was delivered. We got our own flatware and coffee. The second day there was more staff but the waitress decided to change my plain yogurt to blueberry. I am allergic. Had to send it back. I asked for a manager to contact me but no one called. Called corporate and they wanted to give me points. Called Mr. Kong, the president of Best Western and they will give me a 50.00 credit, the first offer was a gift certificate for 50.00 No thanks, I wont ever stay in another Best Western again. The hotel manager has still not contacted me, its been three weeks.	service,environment
its also a naborhood pool.	facility
Cramped location with odd entry by traffic light, clearly caters to groups and sports teams. Nicest staff ever! Room was clean and comfortable, is a single story building, so rooms go on forever down long hallways. Lucky we were near the gym, which was better than most. Great breakfast at a very reasonable price. Room includes a voucher for up to 14.00 of your breakfast order, so you get a hot meal straight from the short order cook, not some steam table/cereal bar like most places. Portions were huge! Free buffet with pizza, cheese/crackers, veggies and dip from 4-7pm on Friday evenings in the bar. Facility is a bit quirky and a bit tired, but staff is warm and friendly.Wish we had eaten dinner there and not at the disappointing Chinese restaurant next door!	service,facility,food
We enjoyed two great days away. They let us check in early and check out late for free. The hot tub was great, pool was a little loud because of school vacation but the attendant was the friendliest gentleman. Wifi didnt work well with just one of our three devices. Breakfast was definitely worth getting out of bed for. Will definitely consider staying there again for a getaway or business.	facility,food
This hotel is showing its age. Although my room was clean, everything seemed a little run-down. The carpets seemed old and the door frame had light from the hallway shining through it. The security latch was loose and missing at least one screw. I booked the room in a hurry for a last minute trip. When I got to Watervilled I remembered there are some much nicer places to stay such as the Hampton Inn and the Fireside Inn. For some reason I didnt see these on the hotels.com website.	environment

Room were clean, Bed was comfortable, bathroom was functional. Skip the breakfast the service is very, very slow and food is sub par, they overcooked the eggs Benedict I ordered, plus the cost of 4.25 for juice is expensive. I would recommend going across the street to the Governors Restaurant Bakery. The front desk was very helpful and accommodating....Dear Lawrence S - Thank you for staying with us and taking the time to write this review. Were glad you enjoyed your room and our helpful staff!

We stayed for 3 nights and the first night was great. Room could have been a little cleaner especially the carpet and corners of room. Lots of dust so allergies became a problem. BIG NOTE! This is a dog friendly hotel! I love dogs and have 2 of my own but do not bring them to hotels. The 2nd night a dog actually 2 dogs started barking at 4:00 am. We were woken up until 6:00! The hotel usually has the 1st floor reserved for barking dogs but these people ended up on the 2nd floor. The Hotel kindly gave us credit for the one night. Not sure if I would stay there again.	environment

We booked this hotel about a week ahead of time and were pleased. The hotel was recently updated. The bathrooms were beautiful. Our beds were comfy and clean. The pool and hot tub was a nice touch compared to the chilly weather outside. The only downfall was that someone put our bill under the door in the morning and it was substantially lower than what I had paid through expedia. When I inquired, I was told that it was a mistake and that I should not have gotten a bill. Breakfast was tasty but kind of pricy in the restaurant, the hotel did give us a credit but only for the registered adults. Not a free continental as advertised.	facility,environment,food
the cleaning products they use leave a toxic scent in every hallway and room. I feel bad for the employees hazardousworkingconditions.	service,environment
The hotel was clean and the people at the front desk are happy to help. Same with the staff that took care of our breakfast order. The French toast was really good, same with the oatmeal the potatoes were missing that something special but not bad. Stay away from the turkey bacon....overcooked circles of leathery meat.It was sort of annoying that there was so many people packed into the pool, that it wasnt worth going in, and that was the reason we choose the hotel.There were hockey, cheer, basketball, and gymnastics tournaments in town for the weekendSo hotels and restaurants all were at max capacity.	service,environment,food
I was here for 5 days due to work. The hotel needs some updating and it could be cleaner. The staff is excellent and the restaurant has good food. I would stay here again.	environment,food
Clean, reasonably comfortable, well maintained. Very nice breakfast, extremely reasonable price. If you can get a room facing the courtyard, it is very pleasant and quiet. Like many hotels these days, it seems to be run by kids, who are friendly but not terribly knowledgeable or resourceful. Overall a nice stay, what we expect from Best Western.	environment,food

The room, although fairly comfortable had the sink outside the bath. This created a problem when others were sleeping and someone needed to wash their hands. The breakfast in the restaurant was better than most places we have stayed, even though it was not as good as it could have been. Overall I would only rate this hotel as fair.	facility,food
Smell of freshly smoked marijuana in the halls on the way to the pool all day long. Hotel is suppose to be family friendly and staff was walking through the same halls and didnt appear to care. Pool was rented out to a birthday party of non guests to the hotel so overpacked and could not swim. Later it was quite dirty and the hot tub had hair and dirt floating in it. Was given 2 towels and washclothes for a room with 4 people. Shower only got luke warm. Free breakfast advertised was not free. "Free" is actually for 2 people and you still pay tax and gratuity. Website and book in room states there are snack vending machines at the hotel when there is not. They have soda and ice machines only. Very disappointing.	service,facility
Great location, easy access to the city.	location
Its warm and normal....staff is diligent and polite. Price is a function in these parts and I appreciate the consistency of service.	service
If you need an elevator this is not the place to go. It is in a strange place. The breakfast was not at all to rave about. Muffins, scrambled eggs & cold cereal, juice. We didnt use the pool, no time for that.	facility,food

nice experience, breakfast the first day was questionable, but we tried the next day and was pleased.	food
Well they must be in the midst of renovations because they did not tell any of their customers and there was dust and materials left all over the hallways. It was like the workers just up and left everything out in the open and materials all over the place. The beds were uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the heating unit. The blinds were duct taped together and the parking lights came through the curtains. And the continental breakfast was a joke. My family went down at 8:15 am and they had nothing ready. Needless to say I am never going to stay there again and we checked out early and went to eat at the Friendlys next door where it was cleaner.I wish that I can get my money refunded because it was not worth the money that I spent.	facility
Easy to access from I-95, close to restaurants, shopping, nice little town.	location
We only stayed one night but this is a good place to stay. Newly updated it shows with better mattresses and new decor. The hotel is clean and well laid out. It is centrally located with many places to eat. The only negatives were the wifi which seems to become very slow once the hotel filled up and one tv.	facility,location
Overall we were very satisfied with our stay. We were glad to see that many renovations are in the process of being completed, and hopefully will continue. The rooms are dated, but clean. We had dinner in the bar area and breakfast in the dining room. Both were excellent with generous portions! If the need arises, we would definitely stay at this property again.	environment,food

No problems, except that it would be good if you would provide tea bags for the people, like me, who do not drink coffee. Also, you should use larger type for your questionnaire, for those, like me, whose vision is not all that good.	food

When we got to the hotel our room was not available and they tried to give us a double twin bed room when we had payed for a king size. Then we had to wait a half hour for our room, even though when I called earlier in the day they said our room would be ready when we got there and we could come whenever since we had payed already. We also had ants in our room. Overall it was not a great stay,and I would like to request a free night stay or else I probably will not stay at your hotels anymore. I used to stay in them a good amount, and I am sorry to say that but that is how I feel.	facility

Needed to leave a day sooner than expected, knew this at check in and told them so. But since I had booked thru Expedia, they stated that I had to get approval thru them, which I did. Upon check-out I asked to verify that I was only being charged for the 3 nights as opposed to the 4, and they said I was only being charged for the 3 days, and gave me a receipt showing that. But the next day, my credit card used for that stay posted the amount for a 4 night stay. In calling the front desk, I got form letter like answers. I will never use this Best Western hotel or Expedia again.	service
All of the outer safety locks are disabled and there are a lot of nooks and crannies to the hallways of this hotel. So therefore anyone could walk in and be hiding anywhere.

Our room was adequate except for the burn marks in the sink, poor tile work in the bathroom, and a malfunctioning heating/cooling unit.

The unit leaked water onto the carpet and showed signs of having been "patched" with aluminum foil.	facility

Staff was very nice and helpful. We ended up arriving earlier than expected and when I called to see if we could check in early; the response was very welcoming.My only critique would be the constant slamming of doors in the morning by housekeeping. They use the lock bar to keep the door in-locked while they go in and out to clean. The problem then becomes the constant loud slamming of doors.	service
The house keeping staff was kind, but when I asked for things for the room they would tell me to get them myself. The restaurant was not good and the service was worse. One waitress told off another in front of everyone and another waiter ignored our table after taking our order.	service
the cleaning products they use leave a toxic scent in every hallway and room. I feel bad for the employees #hazardousworkingconditions.	service
The room was very spacious. It had a good size fridge, decent microwave and coffee pot. The furnishings were very nice especially the granite topped vanity in the bathroom. Linens were nice and bed comfortable. I loved that there are many, many plugs, a large desk and good office chair at the desk. The restaurant is very good.	facility
This hotel is located right off the highway. Check in was a little off to the right. I thought the entrance should have been located closer to the check in area.

Awesome hotel, we brought our 6 month old son and he absolutely loved the saltwater pool it actually helped his dry skin he had on his back.

Overall our stay was an A+!!	facility,food
The room was clean and in good condition. The walls thin, so heard people in the halls and the fridge was noisy. The staff was excellent from check-in to the restaurant. Food was good and a good value. The Pool area was ok, However the Hot Tub was broken and in poor working condition.	facility,environment,food
The hotel is OK. We stay there because of the big, warm, indoor salt water pool. Service could be better - concierge didnt give us the wi-fi log in at check in; we had to call to get it. Guests get vouchers for breakfast which is ordered off a menu - not convenient if youre in a hurry in the morning like we were. The restaurant opens at 7 and we had to be somewhere at 7:45 with a 10 min drive. The first thing the waitress told us when we walked in was that she just seated a large party and it was going to be a while. Then she left. We had to order overpriced cereal and oatmeal and wolf it down.	service,facility,food
I thought the place was great. IMy only problem was that they didnt have the hot tub that Hotels.com had listed. Otherwise, the place was clean, modern and convenient. The beds were really comfortable. The food in the restaurant not so much. We got a coupon for $7 off per person for breakfast but we waited over 40 minutes for our breakfast and when it did arrive it was cold.	facility,environment,food
hotel room clean - beds comfy - advertised free wi-fi in rm and our rm had no wi-fi and when I went to the lobby they had 3 computers but only 1 worked. Free breakfast was really bad.	facility,environment,food
The pool and hot tub area was wonderful! The pool attendant could have let our kids do a bit more in the pool we are are responsible parents and were watching them ourselves. We wanted them to have fun and not have a pool attendant constantly on top of them. The fitness room was big and spacious.	facility
This hotel was extremely clean and staff was excellent and friendly. Would highly recommend friends to stay here. Plan on returning. Hope it stays as is. There is nothing to improve. Even let your four-legged friends stay. Wonderful hotel and state!!!	service,environment
We only spent a night - got there late and left early morning. Front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. AC unit was very noisy.	service,facility
We were spending only 1 night to help out with my Dad. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, Our room was on the first floor, which I normally do not like, was very spacious (desk, sitting chair, refrigerator, large TV King Bed). The bathroom had been refurbished with a nice vanity and new surround for tub and shower.	service,facility
Hotel was clean and room size was fine. Mini fridge and microwave in room were a plus. Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment. Restaurant food was good (we got a $14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost $20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there. Overall this was a decent hotel and much better than what others in our group experienced at competitors in the area.	facility,environment,food
This hotel is great. My only negative review would be the comfort of the bed. I was very firm, so much that I couldnt get comfortable. Just not my preference. Pool us great, food in the restaurant is good. Staff is very friendly.	service,facility
Ok overall - we stayed one night with our dogs. We were limited in our choices because of this. Hotel could use updating. Was a little bit noisy in the halls, but overall ok. Did not eat on site but at Governors across the street.	environment
Staff very friendly.  Some areas of the hotel look like they have been updated but some do not.  Room was clean but halls looked dated and worn.  I have not stayed in other hotels in area so I donthe have a basis for comparison.  Convenient to highway.	service,environment
The pool and hot tub area was wonderful! The pool attendant could have let our kids do a bit more in the pool we are are responsible parents and were watching them ourselves.

I asked for a nonsmoking room and was pleased with the fact that it didnt seem like other people were smoking, so thats good. You get a $7 breakfast credit for the restaurant which was cool, although I think I prefer traditional continental breakfasts that are buffet style. The wifi was fast, so that was good. I didnt use the pool/hot tub/gym BUT it looked clean and ready to use. The staff was very friendly and helpful.	service,facility,food
Great breakfast, clean room! Nice staff, friendly and helpful. Large, comfortable room.	service,food
The hotel is great for a three star - best thing about it really is the staff - very helpful.	service
Im from the city and found it to be comfortable and quiet-- my friend is from the country and was bothered by the lights from the outside and the late-night chatter of guests next door.	environment
The hotel was fine overall, but when I grabbed the last bath towel I found it to be of rag quality. It was literally frayed on the end and you could see thin patches when the towel was held up. For $100 per night, I would expect better quality. The hotel room was neat and clean and staff was friendly. I would stay again, but check the towels before I needed to use one! Nice pool and hot tub area.	service,environment
We have stayed here on two different occasions and could not be happier. Very clean !!! Staff pleasant and helpful. Includes a real breakfast at a real restaurant on site. We love that! And husband with back issues really likes the salt water pool and hot tub. I go for the treadmill. Overall we look forward to staying at Best...Dear E5985FNmarye - Thank you for the taking the time to write this awesome review! Were happy you enjoyed your time with us, and look forward to having you back to rest and relax with us again soon!	service,facility,environment,food
We stayed for 3 nights and the first night was great. Room could have been a little cleaner especially the carpet and corners of room. Lots of dust so allergies became a problem. BIG NOTE! This is a dog friendly hotel! I love dogs and have 2 of my own but do not bring them to hotels. The 2nd night a dog actually 2 dogs started barking at 4:00 am. We were woken up until @6:00! The hotel usually has the 1st floor reserved for barking dogs but these people ended up on the 2nd floor. The Hotel kindly gave us credit for the one night. Not sure if I would stay there again.	environment
staff very nice. clean place.	service,environment
Very loud rowdy customers staff would not do anything about the frat like partying.  Pool was good, hot tub was disgusting.  I really do not have anything good to say about this hotel.  I will never stay here again or recommend it to anyone.	service,facility
The motel was very nice place and the staff were great at all time. They were ready to help all the time. My wife sister died while we were there. They could not do enough for us. The only thing is they keep it to cold at the front desk and restaurant. We would stay there the next time we go buy.	service
Excellent hotel. I was there for a conference and found it to be in a good central location. The room was very comfortable, clean and was the perfect spot to stay. I also enoyed having the restaurant/bar right in the hotel. I would happily stay here again.	location
The hotel was as good as it was advertised to be.  The attached restaurant was better than expected; the food was reasonably priced and of excellent quality.  Everyone was friendly and very helpful.  We would most definitely stay here again.	food
The staff was fantastic.  Nice room.  Could have used more than 2 bath towels.  It was a little noisy in the morning... I think it had to do with the washing machine... sounded like a loud helicopter.  I was a little disappointed when I went to swim in the morning that there was a senior exercise class going on using the entire pool and only a single lap aisle so no room for me to take a swim.It was a good stay and I would stay there again.	service,facility
overall an 8, breakfast was acceptable (better last few times before) upgraded cable service would make stay much better. matress on both double beds on third floor way too soft but had no problems with 1st ir second floors at earlier stays.	facility,food
There puddles located throughout the hotel that should have been vacuumed up but werent. The pub furniture had seen better days. The reasturant had no heat one morning for breakfast. Nothing seemed to be working. This hotel needs a complete makeover. The workout facitlies are shared with the local peoples, who buy membership - so competition to use treadmills with folks other than those staying at the hotel. I had a sirlion steak for dinner and it was 3/4 fat, advertised with cajun spices - it had none - tasted as though it was thawed and boilded in water - disgusting. The vegitables were so mushy you couldnt pick them up with your fork. I would avoid this hotel until they do some major renovations!	facility,food
Stayed here while doing some lake fishing for a few nights. Staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel is older but they come in and clean room every. Wifi works well. Comes with voucher for breakfast. I read some bad comments about the food but we found it to be very good. You can get the buffet on the weekend or order off the menu with a certain $ credit. Eggs, french toast and pancakes with fresh Maine blueberries very good. Yogurt parfait with granola also yummy. Located on a busy street, many shops and places to eat right there.	service,facility,food
We will not be staying at this hotel again. Our room had no heat, the shower curtain had mold on it and the hotel was not very clean. We tried to go to the pool/hot tub but it was packed. There was a birthday party at the pool at 7:30 at night for a pre-teen boy. It was very loud and the pool area smelled horrible. Then to top it all off the bed was horribly uncomfortable.	facility,environment
Crazy lady at the desk would not give me a receipt - she said I had to get it from hotel. Com. And the guest computer / businesss center had such a strong fire wall I could not open my flash drive to open my documents and micro soft office. The man in the hot tub followed me into the locker room and made an offer to give me free whatever - thats not the hotels fault just kinda crazy. Not a bad place.	service,food
We were in Waterville for our Colby reunion. Hotel was fine. Service was pretty slow in the hotel restaurant where we had our breakfast, but luckily we were not in a rush. Breakfast was fine, waitstaff pleasant.	service,food
The food at breakfast was good but we had to wait 40 minutes to get it because there was only one cook working.	food
I was here for 5 days due to work. The hotel needs some updating and it could be cleaner. The staff is excellent and the restaurant has good food. I would stay here again.	service,environment,food
The hotel was nice in the front however our room was showing its wear.  The carpet was stained and in pretty bad shape however everything else was fine.  Beds were comfortable and bathroom was clean.  TV channels were not that great however that was not a major issue. As the hotel is under renovation, I am hoping that carpets and windows are part of the reno. Would probably stay there again.	facility,environment
Typical, but clean and dog friendly room. Food and service at OBriens Restaurant and Pub was top notch! Sarah was a most pleasant and dedicated bar tender and server. Enjoyed our evening of food and conversation.Dear Sandbar16 - Thank you so much for taking the time to write this review! We hope youll be back with us again in the future. Well be sure to pass along your kind words to Sarah at OBriens.	service,environment,food
The Best Western Plus brand is consistently decent, and this hotel did not disappoint. It was nice to have a fridge and microwave in the room- a huge plus!	facility
The hotel was right off the highway but not so close as to experience traffic noises. The room was nicely decorated and very clean. I have stayed at a lot of hotels this year and this one by far was the best. Great bed. Slept like a log and woke refreshed. We ate at the in hotel reasturaunt and were extreemly pleased. overall A++.	environment,location
HVAC was a problem that cause not a good sleep Restaurant service was slow not attending properly (not good service for businessman )	service
Room was really dry. And I got a rash from the salt water pool.	facility
Uninspiring and tired looking...I should have booked the Hotel across the street which looked newer was cheaper...and next to a Starbucks.	location
We found this motel to be pleasant, clean and affordable. Very helpful staff. Attached Irish bar/restaurant we great. The breakfast voucher for the restaurant was a delightful surprise for a real breakfast. I would highly recommend this Best Western.	service,food
Ok place, needs some paint and new clean carpet. Stains on bed cover.	facility
The room, although fairly comfortable had the sink outside the bath. This created a problem when others were sleeping and someone needed to wash their hands. The breakfast in the restaurant was better than most places we have stayed, even though it was not as good as it could have been. Overall I would only rate this hotel as fair.	facility,food
The hotel was under renovations when we got there, that would have been nice to know prior to booking, it just didnt look nice from the outside and some area on the inside also. Other than that the staff were nice and accomodating, it was convenient to have a full restaurant/pub in the hotel, for different optionsat breakfast, not just a continental breakfast bar. The housekeeper cleaned our room when we were out and took a knife and pizza pan that belonged to me (obviously thinking it belonged to the hotel) and the restaurant staff managed to scour the kitchen, find and return them to me before I left (not an easy task to find one knife). All in all it was a nice stay, and I wouldnt mind returning, I would like to see the improvements.	service,food
The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. After 10 days they felt like family. The restaurant is very good as well. Was happy that my room had a refrigerator and a nice little view of the courtyard. My only hope for my next stay would be better cleaning/upkeep of the air conditioning/heating unit. I suffered awful upper respiratory symptoms when the unit was in use. Im guessing the filters need to be cleaned and/or replaced more frequently.	service,facility,food
very convenient for over night stay right off the I-95. restaurant & pub in hotel, gas station across street and other fast food restaurant up the road and a few shopping stores.	food,location
Nice rooms. Very clean. Front staff was polite and courteous.	service,environment
Nice and friendly staff.	service
Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel is in close proximity to Colby College Museum of Art (great collection of regional and international artists). OBriens Irish Restaurant and Pub is located on the property and offers a good selection of breakfast and dinner options. My understanding is hat this hotel was recently upgraded, although it is hard to tell colors.	food
This hotel is used for Winter Romp each year. The cost is not too expensive. The room is a good size. There was two beds in the room. It is in good condition for the price we pay. There is lots of parking. Breakfast was included which was great. Will return again.	facility,food.
Hotel was convenient to I95 and well above average in appearance and appointments. Staff was very gracious and accommodating. We were passing through so one night stay. Did not eat in restaurant because alternatives were very close by. Rate was not a bargain but worth the price.	service,location
Hotel was good. Indoor pool was the draw AND it was actually very warm. Great job! However, I do NOT recommend eating at the hotel restaurant...HORRIBLE service, so/so food quality. With only 3 people at the bar and 2 in restaurant it shouldnt have taken 35 minutes to get an order of nachos, then when it came out, the order was wrong!! Waited another 30 mins for the main dish. Pasta over cooked, chicken rubbery, even my 4 yr old wouldnt eat it. Good stay, but eat elsewhere.	service,facility
Conveniently located, very efficient staff, reasonably priced.	service,location
Location of this hotel was convenient to 95 and not far from downtown (by car) to Waterville. The only complaint I would voice would be that the outer door that was used for entry to the building in the back of the hotel was kept open at night due to a broken lock. This added a sense of less security to me as a single traveler.	location
To our surprise the hotel was under a major reintivation, with construction materials everywhere, cluttered throughout, dirty and not well maintained. The pictures of the property on the web did not match what we actually experienced. No security at the hotel, as all of the doors from the parking lot and center courtyard where broken and not using the key pad to enter. Anyone could enter the building. Crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building. The A/C unit was very old with missing knobs and instructions that were worn off. Getting the room to a comfortable temperature was a challenge. Dirty used towels were hanging in the shower questioning whether the room had been properly cleaned from the prior occupant. Duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains. To top that off the mattress was as hard as a rock making sleeping nearly impossible.If it was not for us driving all day and that it was late in the evening we would have not stayed at this hotel. Worst experience at a hotel in my life time. To top it off, we paid way too much for the room based on the experience and status of the property. Terrible experience!	service,facility,environment
Halls reeked of marijuana. Pool was overpacked with non guests from a birthday party rental. They offer memberships to the pool and exercise room to non guests. Pool was not very clean. Was given 2 towels and wash clothes for 4 people in a room. Website stated free breakfast but neglected to say it was for 2 and you pay tax and gratuity for the free ones also. Website and book in room said there are snack vending machines and there are only ice and soda vending machines. Shower was luke warm and no way to make it warmer. Worst hotel I have ever stayed in.	facility,food
My son and I thoroughly enjoyed our 4 day stay, the rooms were VERY clean, the staff courteous and the hospitality OUTSTANDING. Please post these comments, thanks.	service,environment
We found this hotel while travelling and had read a few bad reviews due to it being renovated!!! We had time to go echeck it out before actually booking!! We asked to see a room and were very pleasantly surprises by how lovely and new the hotel and room was!! They. Have done a great job of the Reno!! The hallways, rooms and main areas are clean plus and very tastefully decorated!! The room had great beds and high end quality linens. The room was large and spacious!! We stayed at the hotel for dinner as there was a bar/restaurant on the premesis!! Super friendly staff and the food was of very good quality for pub food!! Nice not to have to go looking for a place to eat after being on the road all day! Another of the hotel amenities was the great gym and pool area!! Dosen,t get any better anywhere!!! High end equipment , pool and jacuzzi!, another great perk is, in the morning the from lobby staff give you a $7.00 voucher per person for breakfast in the hotel!!! This is not your average Best Western!! We had a lovely bacon/ egg brkf for $0,,, All the staff were super friendly and seemed like they loved their jobs!!! My only complaint is the fact that people are allowd to smoke in some of the rooms!! Smoking is not segregated by floors!! We instantly could smell cig smoke when we went to the second floor!! We also could smell MJ coming from one room!! To bad this hotel is allowing smoking within especially since they have done such a fine job of renovating!! In this day and age, smoking in hotels or anywhere inside is just not acceptable!! I hope this hotel changes their policy as it would be a shame to ruin such a great Reno,d to new hotel!!	service,facility,food
We stayed here for 1 night. Rooms were clean and relatively comfortable. The restaurant is more of a bar and we were the only people that ate there that evening (there seemed to be quite a few people in the bar end though), the waiter was very helpful, the food was average (burgers, sandwiches and fries). NB breakfast is not.	environment,food
Excellent value, nice clean room , quiet, had fun at the bar our bartender was REALY nice and friendly. For sure this would be my second home if it wasnt so far away from my Massachusetts home. Would definitely recommend this Hotel to anyone staying in the area.Dear T2359WMstephenb - Thanks so much for the kind words! We are glad you enjoyed your stay, and we look forward to having you back with us on your next trip to the area :)	service,environment
I had a wonderful time at the best Western. My kids loved the pool and jetted spa. The staff where friendly and helpful.	service,facility
We have stayed here a couple of times. The rooms are ok, the facilities are ok, the staff is terrific. The staff is very friendly and service oriented, they are what keep us coming back. There is a pool and work out area. The restaurant could use some updating. The rooms were clean.	facility,environment
This hotel is absolutely disgusting! You could not pay me to stay here again. We requested a non smoking room , but the entire first floor smelled of smoke!! Rooms are very old and dark. Shower which I was even scared to step into barefoot didnt get above Luke warm. The little coffee machine in the room also didnt work..it was just bad all the way around!! I wasnt expecting fancy being a best western but clean and not outdated would have been nice! Stay elsewhere! !	facility,environment
Upgraded motel with an extremely comfortable bed and quiet room on the top (third) floor. We enjoyed our breakfast and the allowance (14) given to cover breakfast. I definitely would consider staying at the Best Western Plus if I was staying in Waterville again.	food
My family stayed at this hotel and had a great weekend. The pool was huge and my kids loved it. The restaurant gives you a hot breakfast, not a microwaved one and the rooms were very clean. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and I want to thank the staff for a fun weekend away!!!	service,facility,food
I enjoyed having the restaurant in the hotel as well as the $14.00 breakfast voucher.	food
Room, Pool and Restaurant were better than expected for a Best Western.	facility,food
The room was great! Lots of space, good full-length mirrors, and an excellent bed. The closet could have been better. It was very shallow and needed to be deeper for clothes to hang properly.	facility
Hotel Room was clean and comfortable.  We would recommend. We stayed because we were visiting Thomas College.	environment
All the hallways smell of smoke. The room was dirty when we checked in. The next day they never sent housekeeping to clean. Did not give us clean towels in spite of the request for those and housekeeping services. They said the housekeepers had all gone home. The restaurant was terrible service.  One person waiting on the room over breakfast the first day. Twenty minutes to receive a menu and then nothing after the meal was delivered. We got our own flatware and coffee. The second day there was more staff but the waitress decided to change my plain yogurt to blueberry. I am allergic. Had to send it back. I asked for a manager to contact me but no one called. Called corporate and they wanted to give me points. Called Mr. Kong, the president of Best Western and they will give me a $50.00 credit, the first offer was a gift certificate for $50.00  No thanks, I wont ever stay in another Best Western again. The hotel manager has still not contacted me, its been three weeks.	service,environment
hot tub too hot,(over 100),but pool was great.room was clean and bed was very comfortable.toilet was too small as was the bath room.but I felt safe . breakfast is big $$$ otherwise ok.	environment

I was attending a business conference in the area. I chose this hotel for its location, price, and because they have a pool and fitness room on-site. The Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was clean and well appointed. I enjoyed using the fitness room, but the pool was a nightmare. Despite the fact that there were signs everywhere saying.	service,facility
I would recommend this hotel to family and friends. All the staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel was clean and decorated very well. I loved the courtyard with the trees and beautiful flowerbeds. It is the perfect place to have a picnic lunch. The saltwater pool was great and very relaxing. I really enjoyed my stay and plan to.	service,environment
Two pillowcases and the sheet had hair on it. I think just left over from the a laundering process but still disconcerting and if we had not arrived so late at night, I would have asked to switch rooms.	facility
This hotel was nice. Nothing extra. The staff was very pleasant and accommodating. Would stay here again.	service
We really enjoyed our stay at the Best Western Grand. It was an older hotel buy very comfortable, and the pool and the hot tub were clean. And even though there is a restaurant there, they also provided a continental breakfast. This worked out well for us, because we did not have time for a sit down breakfast the morning we checked out.	facility,food
overall pleasant  good breakfast. clean room easy to get to.	environment,food,
Connectivity in the rooms is a joke. Go somewhere else if you need internet. Imagine if a hotel told you that because the place was full, the toilets were going to flush every once in a while, and that the best idea would be to flush when no one else was in the hotel. Apart from the internet, the place.	facility
Clean rooms and nice pool. Great breakfast and wait staff.	service,environment,food
Good parking for vehicles w/ trailers.	facility
first time staying here. room was great, very clean and spacious. bed was very comfortable which is not the case at most places weve stayed before. pool and hot tub were clean, indoor, and convenient to use. staff was friendly and the included breakfast in the resturant was awesome, not just the usual donuts, fruit, and coffee. overall very satisfied.	service,environment,food

My two daughters and I stayed in the hotels suite for a local dance competition. The room was nice and the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom could have been cleaner, but overall we were happy.	facility
Nice stop over hotel near some shops. The hotel had a pool and hot tub but these could do with some work. Had a nice friendly bar to relax in.	facility
The room was very small, the cable was fuzzy and not HD, and all the doors stuck or were not properly fitted for the opening. This was a $90 room, not at $150 room. Way over priced for location and condition. Not what I would expect from Best Western.	facility
From check in to the day we left very comfortable and rooms were very clean, staff very helpful.	service,environment
The hotel was adequate and met my basic needs. It met my expectations for this type of hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. The TV was difficult to use - you couldnt get directly to a specific channel and it didnt have all the network channels, presumably b/c it was DirectTV. The continental breakfast consisted of coffee/tea and muffins so I wouldnt really call it a continental breakfast.	service,facility,food
Great place to stay when visiting your child at Colby! The hotel is convenient to campus. Rooms are good - beds are comfortable. Breakfast is good. Fitness center looks decent. We will stay there again when visiting Colby.	location
The motel was very nice place and the staff were great at all time. They were ready to help all the time. My wife sister died while we were there. They could not do enough for us. The only thing is they keep it to cold at he front desk and restaurant. We would stay there the next time we go buy.	service

Wonderful stay, Staff was so helpful.	service
Room was clean, spacious and comfortable, Restaurant (OReilys) was charming with modestly priced good food, but limited menu. We had a back inside room which was quiet and easily accessed. They include a breakfast beginning at 7:00 but we had to leave before 7 so cannot comment on the breakfast.	environment,food
This place was right off the highway, but not too noisy. The rooms were spacious and clean. There was a pool and exercise room. But the best part was OBriens, where you could get meals and drinks on the premises. Lively atmosphere, with good food and great service.	facility,environment,food
On our trip to Canada from Connecticut, We stayed the night in this lovely hotel. They brought the suitcases to our rooms in record time, and there were cookies and juice waiting for all visitors. Add to that a lovely buffet breakfast in the morning before we got on our way. It was a great experience with clean rooms.	environment,food
Problematic wifi.	facility
one handicap parking spot per entrance, broken bed, not handicap friendly. internet never worked over two days. Told front desk I couldnt walk far so I need something close to the exit they put me as far away as they could.	facility
The hotel was fine, just know that smoking is allowed on some floors so there is lingering tobacco odor in some corridors. OBriens was a nice surprise, good food and great service. Also, a true breakfast is included with the price of the room, cooked to order not the typical complimentary breakfast buffet. The internet speed was good as well.	food
Nice and friendly staff.	service

The hotel was excellent in all aspects. Lobby was warm and friendly, staff was knowledgeable. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet. My one night stay was outstanding.

The Best Western in Waterville was nice and clean. The room was nice. The receptionist checking me in, however, appeared to have no interest in her job or me. I was very disappointed that the WIFI did not work in my room. When I complained about it in the morning I was told it works great in all rooms.	facility,environment
Clean hotel. Great breakfast. Good value. OBriens restaurant makes a great breakfast that is individually prepared, not the typical rubber egg buffet that you get at most hotels. Good deal for the price. I will go there again for my next business trip to Waterville.	environment,food

Traveling with a dog and this was a nice, clean hotel and conference center. Had breakfast at the restaurant the next morning and it was awesome -- complete with waitresses, juice and eggs cooked to order. Best breakfast on our trip. Hotel gives you a voucher, so you have to pay a little money for the breakfast.	environment,food
We stayed for the weekend, good area for shopping, the place needs a little updating, but the staff more than makes up for that. We go there because of the pool and hot tub. They have a very nice breakfast plan where you can order what you like from their restaurant for the breakfast.	service,facility,food
This hotel is very conveniently located just off I-95 (theres a Ruby Tuesday Restaurant just a short walk away - we had a nice dinner there). The staff at check-in was not very friendly (they just did their basic job and didnt look quite happy). Our room was clean and spacious (king sized bed, flatscreen tv, fridge, microwave.	service,facility,environment,location
Pool staff do not enforce rules. Many adults buy memberships to the pool and fitness center, therefore have an expectation that they will be able to use the facility as it is intended. Instead, there are frequently screaming and out of control children at the pool, especially on weekends. The rooms are very nice, as is the restaurant.	service,facility
Not looking to break the bank on a hotel overnight - looking for clean, quiet and comfortable. This hotel fit the bill. We were 2 adults and a teen, so wish they had larger than double-sized beds, and it would have been better to have had 3 bath towels instead of 2. But the TV worked, the heat worked.	facility,environment
I recently had two visits to this location. For both visits my reservation was for a room with a king bed. However, when I checked in for the first visit I was informed that the room I had reserved wasnt available and they put me in a room with two double beds. This in itself wasnt a big issue.	facility,location
We enjoyed our stay. It was quiet even though there were many teenagers staying there. The breakfast was delicious. The people at the desk were very helpful and informative. We would certainly return to this hotel.	food
My wife and my in-laws stayed here over Thanksgiving weekend. We chose it because they are pet friendly, up to 85 pounds I believe. Our room was as nice as you would expect from a Best Western. The room service did not turn the heat off during the day so it was sweltering at night when we got back.	service
Seeing as its in the middle of Maine, youre not going to get a 5-star hotel. However, this is probably the best in the area. Ive had WiFi issues here in the past, but this time I had the 3rd floor, and no issues at all. So, Id suggest 3rd floor.	facility
good location close to the highway, quiet rooms but small bathrooms,comfortable beds with luxury linens, friendly staff throughout and good food at the restaurant, make sure you try the prime rib...it was excellent...great value and a nice place to stay, pet friendly also.	service,location
Overall a good place to stay. Restaurant served a great dinner although it was noisy ,because it was wing night, it attracted a lot of beer drinkers. Also the room heater/fan was noisy. The sit down service breakfast was excellent and had a good selection.	facility,food
staff was not friendly.	service
It was a comfortable stay. I will say that the walls are a bit thin. I didnt like hearing slamming doors throughout the night from other guests. The room was fairly clean. The beds were really comfortable. Breakfast was decent. The front desk clerk could be a bit more friendlier. I would stay there again.	facility,environment,food
When we first walked into our building, there was a skunky smell. Luckily, our room wasnt quite as bad. We did go across the street to the grocery store and got some air spray for our room. The pillows were not the best quality. The bedspread was thin. The mattress was nice, however. The shower had good water pressure.	service,facility,environment,food,location
Quick one night stay, comfortable with good free hot breakfast.	food
Stayed for a weekend (Thurs-Mon) and thankfully the Tigers Football team was on the road so getting a room wasnt hard. It was a great value for the little cost of the room. If youre on a tight budget, this place is great. If youre looking for a resort stay and planning on spending your entire trip in the hotel, this is not your place. Bed was great to sleep in, shower was hot to bathe in. All I needed the room for.	facility
This was a fantastic stay. The employees were great! Had a light bulb break and they came straight away and cleaned it up. Nice pillows. Close to a lot of eateries.	service,facility
The cleaning staff left dirty towels in our room which we found when we checked into our room. The onsite clerk came to pick them up but did not apologize and was hesitant when we first asked her.	service
Second year staying here for True/False. The room is fine. Breakfast is better than a lot of other budget places.	food
I booked the hotel last minute as I was simply too tired to continue driving. Im in grad school so I needed cheap. Considering the price, the hotel amenities and upkeep was as expected. The staff was friendly enough, the hotel smelled like mildew, serious updates were needed, and the continental breakfast was lacking. The only things that I considered to be under what I paid was the bed and room itself. The bed was terribly uncomfortable. The pillows were hard and lumpy...like when you wash and then high heat dry artificial pillow stuffing and it melts together. The AC unit didnt really work. It just blew air. I was hoping it would cool down to kill the mildew smell, but it never did. The worst was that every time the AC unit kicked off, a noise would start (Im assuming some kind of duct work) that sounded like someone was knocking at my door. This continued through the night so needless to say, I didnt sleep very well.	service,facility
I would recommend this hotel to others. It was a nice facility nice room and accommodation.	facility
Hotel was clean, the kids had fun swimming and had a room closet to the pool. Breakfast was good.	facility,environment,food
Showed up on Friday left on Sunday. Everything was good. Breakfast was great. Very nice staff. The only problem was the bathroom. The toilet, shower head, and tub faucet were loose. It looks like they tried to update the tub area but didnt do a good job of it. The lights in the bathroom are exetremely hot. Other than that good trip.	service,facility,food
Bed was very firm and uncomfortable TV speaker had a lot of static like it was busted remote didnt work very good and our key cards would not open the outside doors most of the time.	facility
Clean room, good service, a decent breakfast bar. My only complaint is that the booking site said nothing about an additional 100.00 cash deposit (refundable) for those who pay cash. A very unpleasant surprise when we checked in.	facility,environment,food
i would been nice if we didnt get the wheelchair accessible. Bathroom is for wheelchair accessible not for family.	facility
Great just a suggestion: sheet between blanket so no touching blanket. When asked for extra blanket, i got a bedspread- they are so dirty should not be used in any hotel.	facility,environment
Clean. Great for a one nighter. Only bad part was the traffic at ruch hr.	environment
The room and hotel were generally clean. Some areas of the parking lot were too dark for my liking, but there were more than enough spaces. About what you would expect for the price.	facility,environment
Was really close to show me games.	location
My daughter was moving into Mizzou so we went up the night before I made the reservations online I must say when I walked into the lobby of the hotel seem older but nice I then checked into my room went and got something to eat came back use the restroom to see two tiny bugs not sure what they were at this point I killed them and wanted to my room saw a roach crawling up my drink when I called the front desk I told the guy I have bugs in my room he said yes as if this were a regular occurrence and then took him about 15 minutes to get me moved to a different room to say the least I was absolutely mortified this hotel is disgusting.	service,facility,environment
Overall a very pleasant stay. Newer flat screen TV with a great variety of channels to pick from and the bed was very comfy. Plenty of parking and the staff were very friendly. I would gladly stay here again!	service,facility
The stay was good except for the room not being cleaned before we checked in.	service
Convenient location right off the highway. Bed was comfortable, room was warm. Felt safe traveling alone. Hotel is a little outdated and worn around the edges, but you can tell they work to keep it clean.	facility,environment,location
Worst hotel stay I have had in years. Stains on sheets Noisy others staying in hotel Room made lots of noise from above Service was lacking at best.	facility,environment
Hotel is in desperate need of remodeling! Carpet was dingy, bathtub was and bath fixtures were old. Door was loose, even when locked, safety issue. But Good location, close to the interstate.	facility,location
Building security was an issue.	environment
Hotel was ok just about all the staff did a great job except the night shift desk cleark. Called my room at 4 am because he didnt know how to do something and after a few realized he called wrong room. Pluse peoples kid down the hall slammed there door all night long.	service
It was a nice room. pleasant to the eye. But the TV keep mess up. But I didnt complain, because we were out most of the day. I didnt know about it because I went to bed. My daughter told me about it the next day. The night stand was dirty. But rest of room looked clean. Towels were hard.	facility,environment
Workers, check in, and check out were great!! Grounds and rooms need be cleaner. Bad musty, wet smell when entering building.	environment
They allow pets (dogs only) in this hotel, which is probably great for pet owners, but not so great when the dogs have accidents, and the hallway smells of doggy poo. It was cleaned up, but the smell did linger. Otherwise hotel was a good value for the price. And I would recommend to people who absolutely have to take their dogs with them while they travel.	environment
The service, location and room were in line with the price. The hotel is dated but the service was friendly, room was clean.	service,environment,location
Very in the middle of nowhere. Did not feel safe or clean. Walls very thin. Breakfast minimal.	environment,food
Possibly the smokiest hotel room Ive ever been in. Pulling the covers up would release yet another cloud of smoke an awful experience, for sure. To top it off, upon return home, everything in our bags, including the bags themselves required washing! Old and smoky.	environment
Hotel is old but you get what you pay for. Price was one of the cheapest in the area but the hotel was pretty old you cant change that. Bed was comfortable. Breakfast wasnt great but typical. All staff was very nice.	service,facility,food
This hotel isnt bad for the price I paid. It is located in a great spot. Easy to get to.	location
Very affordable. Very clean room. Lobby and meeting rooms a little outdated. Breakfast area was clean and well stocked. Friendly staff. We needed a place before and after surgery. Meet our needs. We will stay again.	service,environment
There were only a hand full of cars in the parking lot. But room was adequate although there was a fairly loud drone sound coming from the roof that I could hear not only in my room but also as I walked down the hall. I speculated that it was an HVAC unit on the roof. It was annoying but do -able so I didnt complain.	facility,environment
The hotel is in a prime location. Close to the highway and easy to get to. Breakfast was OK, but lacked variety. Some eggs and more fruit options would have been nice. The other issue is how loud it was in the halls at night. Doors banging and people talking went right through the walls. Hard to get a good night sleep. The front desk was very helpful and friendly. I did have trouble accessing the WiFi. Overall it wasnt a bad stay but there were issues.	service,facility,food,location
Enjoyed everything but that hard Ole soap..not pleasant and too hard. Also only 1 washclothe.	facility
Everything was great. Only thing that disturbed me, was a notice on the desk in the room. Advising how to lock your car and what not to leave in it. That means to me, that there are a lot of car break-ins. But like I said, we didnt have a problem and a good experience.	facility
Stay was fine. Sneezed/coughed a bit my first night there, but seems to lessen the second night. Hotel looked great, but rooms are clean, but bathroom a little worn. Toilet is really low, but bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. Free breakfast, can be slightly more balance nutritionally, but it was okay.	facility,environment,food
I could not sleep. It was noisey from 2:40 An until 4:05 AM. The bathroom floors needed to be cleaned.	environment
Managers were great. However maid service was lacking. Had to request service. When we did receive service it was poor. Also had to constantly get room key reprogramed.	service
Our room was musty and it stunk to high heaven. Do not recommend this place. The building was old and dirty. Bad experience.	environment
My friends and I enjoyed the hotel. The staff was helpful and got us set up with a nice taxi service. The room serves its purpose of a place to get ready for a concert and then come back late and get some good sleep before heading home.	service
great value quiet clean and comfortable.	environment
This hotel is the best bang for your buck in Columbia. Great location, very clean, very nice staff and rooms are large and come with a microwave,fridge and coffee pot. Its older but redecroated rooms make it feel like home. I have 2 kids going to school in Columbia and when I come to visit I always check to see if this hotel has the best deal and it usually does. I stay here whenever I can, highly recommend for the price.	service,facility,environment,location
I wont stay at a Howard Johnson again. Had to be moved to a different room cause the key card wouldnt work. Asked for a non smoking room and room used to be a smoking room. It smelled like an ash tray, bedding had burn holes in it. Staff was very nice and helpful but was a very nasty feeling in either room. The second room didnt smell like an ash tray but did have a weird funk to it. There were random hairs find in the room. The ac was having a hard time keeping up on a 75day. Key cards had to be redone multiple times. Shower curtain was thin so water got all over the floor. Pillows were the size of my hand. All in all not a relaxing stay.	service,facility,environment
It was fine. My only complaint (which is minor) is that the bathroom didnt have shampoo (and instead had two conditioner tubes).	facility
Friendly staff, clean room. Good breakfast.	service,environment,food
Older hotel but very clean, breakfast had good selection and attendant kept area clean. We would stay again.	environment,food
Clean room and nice breakfast.	environment,food
We selected the hotel because of the price and it was to include breakfast. The breakfast was to be available beginning at 6:00 am. We went at 6:00, 6:20 and then again at 6:40. The room was dark and there was no food. We asked the desk clerk and he said that the staff didnt come to prepare the food. We left. I cant recommend Howard Johnson to my friends, family or co-workers and I do not plan on using Howard Johnson again.	service,food
We wanted a clean, decent, reasonably priced hotel for the night. This fit the bill.	environment
I just wanted somewhere to sleep for Thanks! night on a cross country trip and I got that. No frills...phone, clock radio and TV not working.	facility
Our room was very clean, the tub was surprisingly large. We had a quiet incident free evening, you cant ask for better than that!	service,facility,environment,food,location
Room was not set up for 2 people only one towel and washcloth. No bathmat to step out on. Only stayed on way to wedding elsewhere.	facility
We thought it was a great hotel for the price. Close to the university of Missouri. An older hotel that has been nicely updated. We go there to visit my son and we would certainly stay there again. Great for the money!	environment
We stayed here for Family Weekend at Mizzou. Hotel was clean and suitable for our needs. Beds were comfortable and it quiet compared to other locations we have stayed at in the past. Parking was very good considering the number of people who attend this type of event. We would stay here again in the future.	facility
Room needed updating, but for the price I could deal with that. What I couldnt overlook was the layer of dust and cobwebs covering the drapes that blows all over the room every time the air kicks on, or the toilet that isnt attached to the floor properly, or the drafty window, mildew stained tile, torn curtains, and cracked microwave door. I also wasnt expecting to spend all night smelling the food from the banquet rooms downstairs. I wasnt expecting to be amazed at the price I paid for this room, but I was at least expecting to have had them keep up with routine maintenance and cleaning, and maybe put in some air fresheners in the hallway to counteract the smells from the banquets. Overall, the bed was comfortable, the shower was hot, and I only needed someplace for 1 night to attend a conference at the university, so it served its purpose.	environment
It was a good hotel for that one night stay kind of a thing. Staff was great, bed was super nice, and location was perfect. It was just over used and cramped. It looked clean but did not feel clean. None smoking rooms smell like smoking rooms and burn marks in comforter.	environment
Needs breakfast meets.	food
This is by far the best cheap hotel in Columbia. Its clean, the rooms have refrigerators and theres no resident scary guests. Book early, on game weekends it sells out fast.	food
The only clean thing about this hotel was the check in. We paid (with tax) 155.00 for the room with 3 beds due to the fact we have older kids and they refuse to sleep in the same bed (no biggie) when we got to our room for the night and turned down the bed the cover had several hairs in-bedded in the cover, the sheets had several cigarette burn holes in it. So needless to say NO ONE slept in the 3rd bed. There was a dead bug under the counter that the coffee maker was on (coffee and no cups) the outlet by the coffee maker when we went to plug in the straighter it would just fall out, the outlet behind the nightstand was literally hanging out of the wall. The little doily that Im assuming should have been on the table under the phone was behind the table and on the floor, Im sure was there for some time...I totally understand a quick cheap place to stay but, when you are up all night worrying about if the place is going to burn down!! NO THANKS! Im glad our room was at the end of the hall by the EXIT door. You will not find my family there. I did speak to a manager (Im assuming since he said he could hear out my issues) and he gave me a whopping 20 off so instead of 155 I am paying 124.00 not satisfied and will not return. Who pays even 124.00 to stay in a place like this!! HJ 1 myself 0..I lost on this bad decision making. I wish I could get the picture to upload. I forgot about the stains on the comforter (the same bed that had hair and cigarette burns on it.	service,environment
The motel was clean and comfortable bed and a good location. People were courteous had a nice breakfast complementary.	environment,food,location
Husband and I stayed one night there we like the room and people that worked there were nice plane on going back wish we could of staying the hole weekend. Hotel has pool. Stores close by if u like to go shopping and restaurants.	facility
After driving 7-1/2 hours I really needed to stop. This place looked cute. Upon entering the lobby was clean and quaint. The prices were very reasonable (65 vs 120 at bigger name brand hotels). I got into my room and it was clean and large. The only negative I could find was the room smelled very musty.	environment
Our room was clean and spacious, right next to the pool on the outside edge, and even included a mini-fridge. We didnt get a chance to have breakfast either day, but the fact that it is offered is nice. Super close to everything, within 10-15 minutes from most attractions/restaurants we wanted to visit. Also, the staff was very friendly.	service,facility,food
The motel is older (still using keys) the room was clean and the beds comfortable. they do need to make some improvements. Carpet was water damaged at the door and then there was fiber missing over by the bathroom. a couple of brown spots on the ceiling from what I would assume was a room leak.	facility,environment
room size was good, bathroom could have been cleaner, there was hair on the floor and walls of the shower.carpet had wet spots on it all over the room. WiFi did not work, poor signal. The bed was average, okay for 1 night.	facility,environment
The desk clerk was kind and friendly. The room had a, strong musty odor, but appeared clean. The pancakes werent very good. Biscuits and gravy were typical for hotel chains. There was no honey, nor cream cheese. They did have bananas and the pastries looked pretty good. The amount of food choices available was pretty limited compared to most average.	service,environment,food
We stayed their one night on our way to tunica ms.Its located next to a large strip mall in osage beach.We stayed in a regular room,but they offer theme rooms as well.We did have a problem with the tv remote,but the lady at the front desk was very nice and curtious,and tried to do another remote but did not work.	service,location
We were able to try out a different suite from our last visit. A hot tub is well worth the extra cost, especially after riding 3 hours on a motorcycle. Room was clean, pool area was nice and surprisingly still open after Labor Day. The free breakfast was ok. We only tried it once during our stay though.	facility,environment,food
I would recommend this hotel to everyone. Nice clean comfortable rooms and the most friendly accommodating staff. Location is literally next to the Outlet Malls and close to everything. Cant wait to go back!	environment,location
Nothing spectacular. Room was very clean. Like most hotels/motels at the Lake, this one could definitely use some updating. There was nothing wrong necessarily, but the decor was very strange. Fake Roman columns in front of the jacuzzi with fake vines running over the top. Lots of wasted space in the room. Plenty of room for a comfortable chair.	facility,environment
Room was clean. Close to shopping. Staff very nice was easy to get in and out We would stay again Was very happy with. Our stay we did not try the breakfast but there was a lot of people in there eating.	service,environment,food
Comfortable bed with crisp sheets and a luxury blanket (not the cheap Polly kind), room smells good, very clean, affordable price, easy to find, plenty of parking, shopping right next door, close to the lake - OVI will continue be our go to place whenever we visit Lake of the Ozarks.	facility,environment
Was very pleased with this hotel. Friendly front desk staff, clean room and very best location. Was nice for couples weekend, and will return with our family. Walking distance of outlet mall and shopping across the highway.	service,location
Our room was a double queen bed accommodation it was very clean and everything worked it had a refrigerator, flat screen T.V. with cable hair dryer and the usual shampoo and soap, etc. My husband wasnt too impressed with the complimentary breakfast bar, but it was okay. We received several good restaurant recommendations from the owner.	facility,environment,food
Stay July 28-31st for a family reunion only have a few complaints. When we got to our room the key lock was jammed called front desk she tried to explain how to jiggle it right so it would open. I didnt know it would take 20 minutes to get the door opened each time but whatever.... The door eventually opened.	service
The hotel itself was not the best, the owners were friendly.	service
Not far for my purpose. Good place to sleep and change. Needs a little improvement when it comes to cleaning a little vacuum not bad daily. We had what we needed cannot complain. Nice people.	service,environment
The photo listing on this website is very deceiving. This motel is dirty and the pictures do not show a true representation of the rooms. The bed linens, as well as the bath towels had black, dirty stains. I would NEVER stay here again!	facility,environment
Terrible water pressure, loose toilet seat, microwave cord was not long enough to reach an outlet and NO SMOKE DETECTOR in room!	facility
This hotel was horrible. The service was horrible, the cleaning crew wore regular street clothes and when they came to my room banging on the door at 11:03am that check out was 11am. I was scared, couldnt tell who they were considering the hotel was in a seedy part of town, next to a truck stop. I asked her (cleaning lady) to identify herself and then she came back with two others who couldnt speak English. Even tho I had another nights reservation, they failed to confirm/check. I asked for towels and was told by owner its a even exchange towel system. Give old towels to get new ones.....wow The bathroom was disgusting, shower curtain hadnt been changed since the place was originally purchased. I could go on on on but Im sure u get my point. If I wasnt in a desperate situation from last minute planning to attend the UK vs USC game in South Carolina and every hotel in the city booked. I would have never ever stayed at that Super 8 hotel.	service,facility,environment
Stayed here for a family visit. Got the job done, at a good price. But not a well-maintaind room. Basic cheap hotel room.	environment
Staff was very nice. The outside appearance is nice. Inside my feet and socks literally turned black from dirty carpet. The Lights, phone, and corners had mold. No pool, coiffed maker broken, half the outlets plugs fell out and a towel had mold on it. I couldnt switch hotels cause area was booked for military graduation.	service,facility
the woman has flipped out didnt realize that I had paid through all my stuff in the parking lot by contact was stolen a couple of the items were stolen it will crack them all over the place tons of illegal activity I feared for my life I will never stay there again I beg you not ever stay there if you are single female I was propositioned about 16x it could even walk out of my room I had a layover for 14 hours at the only reason I picked that hotel is it was 1 mile away I cannot believe they stole things from my suitcase and do all my things in the parking lot he did not know that I had booked another day if you guys get off the property get off the property I called the cops I file charges it was the worst experience of my life she did the same thing to another man he threw coffee in her face she got hit its just it was a hole that experience I cannot believe they stole my things out of my suitcase unbelievable.	facility,environment
Room was infested with cockroaches.	environment
The two rooms given to us did not have running water so the crews were given other rooms but then a lady came yelling at them to get out, when they presented her with the new keys she told them if they did not leave she would call the police. When I tried to get a refund SAM, the mgr said no, they left because they wanted to. We will not refund anything. NOT using them again!	service
The Breakfast was very good. The host showed us how to use the waffle machine. They also had a good cereal selection. He was very friendly. Location was good to get on the highway to visit fort Jackson. The room was very affordable and clean. I was disappointment no one came to clean the room on the 2nd day. The bed sheet had a large spot of what appeared to be an un-washable cooking grease.	service,food
We walked into the lobby and there was stuff all over the place. They set up a folding sight screen to hide their bird and other personal stuff. The motel was a bit creepy. I used one of my shirts to cover the pillow because the place was dirty and not sure I wanted to put my head on their pillow. Had nowhere else to go, otherwise I would have.	facility
Glad I only stayed for a few hours. I didnt feel safe at all traveling as a woman alone.	environment
I am very disappointed that the janitor took my personal face cloth and the bath tub drain looked like a scorpion and there was dust on the bathroom wall,air conditioner,and furniture and most importantly just because I booked my room through 3rd party they did not give me a receipt.	facility
I wanted a cheap hotel while traveling and found this motel. Although cheap, I was still disappointed especially since it still reeked of smoke even though we requested nonsmoking. Also, the walls were paper thin which was not cool. But, it was a cheap bed for the night, so thats what counts.	environment
The hotel stay was alright. I will not stay at the location again.	location
The Hotel was perfect and the food was excellent, close to the beach, 5 kind of restaurant, the Hotel staff is very friendly.	service,food
Its a nice medium size hotel on the beach. With two stories buildings and a few pools spread out. The best part was definitely the staff They truly seem to enjoy their jobs and that makes all the difference. We stayed for four days and had a great, relaxing time. We went as a couple, but could come back with our children: Theres a kids club and some of the rooms have direct access -right of the back door- to a canal system that connect to one pool. If you walk down the beach, five minutes away, you will end crossing a nude beach/hotel. If you have a problem seeing naked people enjoying the sun, walk the other side (to the docks).	service,facility
The resort was beautiful, well kept, and the room was luxurious without being opulent. We upgraded to a swim up room, which was fun for my 10 year old. Every restaurant was great, and so was the room service food. Lots of places to swim, either at the resort or the beach. The staff was consistently friendly and courteous. They had inexpensive activities like paddle boarding and kayaking available, of which we took advantage. My only complaint would be that I had trouble with the Wifi, which I paid to have unlimited access to, but it seemed spotty and inconsistent. Otherwise everything about the resort was lovely, including our giant bathtub. I would happily stay here again, with or without my little one.	service,environment,food
Very positive experience. Could have not ask for a nicer facility with great amenities. Everyone was very nice and recommend for families for sure.	service,facility
nice hotel, lots of accommodations for children. Snorkeling was great! 24 he room service was nice too! Spa was amazing!!	service,facility
The food was great, the service was very inconsistent. Staff are generally very nice and friendly but often got orders wrong, forgot about requests or got us completely different items. This was a challenge given we were traveling with an infant. The front desk staff and concierge services were inconsistent and inflexible as well.	service,food
The positives: Awesome lobby and checkin., resturants above average and 5 to choose from/ room service all hours/ beach is lovely and close/ very clean resort /close to cancun airport./ reasonable workout area Negatives: - staff always seems to be angling for a tip/ the cabana boy mafia controls all the ebacj spots and you have to play their tip game to get a spot/ clothing optional swingers beach is next resort down the beach/ no shuttles to airport or cars to rent to drive to nearby puerto morelos/ way too many kids and children over spring break. Not 1 16-18 year old boy for my daughter to socialize with./ expesive wi fi is not part of all inclusive.	service,environment
The front desk and management we dealt we were very poor. Every simple request required multiple phone calls, and they placed us in a room directly across from daily construction which lasted past 8pm on two occasions, even though we had an infant with us who needed to nap and go to bed early at night. When we asked a manager if we could change rooms, she declined and told us it would end at 5pm that day and there would be no more for the remainder of our trip. It lasted two more full days, and she conveniently had the next day off so we could not address it with her. Also, the check-in process was awful as they made us wait three hours in the hot and humid conditions for our room. However, the restaurants (and their staff) are excellent. I cant say enough about the staff at Blue, as they were extremely friendly and always went out of their way to put a smile on everyones face. The food at all three dinner restaurants (as well as Chil for lunch) was very good, and service was mostly great throughout. Our room itself was very clean, and the pool areas are fantastic. Also, room service was very fast and was also delicious. It was a shame that the front desk dropped the ball on so many occasions because it really could have been an awesome trip, but it was unfortunately blemished by poor customer service on the front end.	service,facility,food
The food was excellent.	food
Charming hotel. Good food for an all inclusive. Great for kids.	food
Beautiful hotel with a Kids Club but still maintains that exclusive feel. Staff goes out if their way to please you. All inclusive implies programming, but trust me, they customize things to please their guests. Wonderful food and wine. One of my best hotel experiences ever.	service,food
We made our reservations a month in advance, my wife called on the day we are suppose to check in, gets the run around of whether or not they will have a room or not! Who runs a business like this When they found a room we were given a couple cards, neither of which opened the door. Overall, you have no feeling of security, even if you are parked next to your room i was constantly checking outside on my vehicle.	environment
Attention do not stay here for any reason! If theres no hotels available youd be better off staying in your vehicle showering a truck stop! They treat their customers like crap, walk in your room w/out permission(waiting for you say anything), try to rush you out the rooms w/the doors open customers arent dressed. If you leave your stuff in the rm they make you pay 25 to get it out wont give you a shuttle ride anywhere until you do. The showers are cold. I told the van driver just a minute after she knocked she swung the door open claiming she didnt hear me. I told her I needed to get dressed she snatched the door open againx2 the curtains while I was getting ready. Dont under any circumstance stay here pleaseyoull regret it! That star needs to be a negative 5!	service
I am the disabled victim of a drunk driver. For 5 years now, I have been on very heavy doses of narcotic pain medication, and will be for life. It is very dangerous living alone, and I wont tolerate another human living with me. So, I have a specially trained dog trained as an alert dog to watch me and make my life safe to live. Last month, we (my dog, Dana and I) went to Ft Lauderdale, and we stayed at the Ocean breeze motel. We had a wonderful stay. The motel doesnt allow regular p...view moreets, which is one of the reasons we chose it. Less to possibly distract Dana. Beyond that, the rates were low enough for a lower income (the drunk was uninsured) disabled man and his K9 assistant. The owners treated us wonderfully, as they treat their property. What a great place to spend a week in paradise. After the grueling Chicago winter we have suffered (08-09), this motel felt like our home away from home, and we would definitely choose them if we ever would go to Ft Lauderdale again.

Hotel was off the strip, but close to a shortcut to downtown -made it easier to avoid some of the traffic. When I was checking in, lady had a meeting or something to get to, so I felt like I was inconveniencing her. Her replacement was ok, not really friendly, but not rude. Staff was better the next day.	service,location
This Days Inn is located off the Strip which is what we wanted. It was still just a few minutes drive to anywhere we wished to go in Branson. The breakfast included waffles, eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy as well as cold cereals and oatmeal. The property is on a steep hill, so park closer to the street and use the stairs closer to the front so youll have fewer flights of stairs to climb. The only complaint we had was that our rooms carpet was dirty, evidently from what the parking lot and walking surfaces had been paved with. We would stay here again though.	facility,food,location
We stayed recently just to take our kids to Silver Dollar City. This is a motel and it is very noisy until at least 11:00 PM. The rooms are fine enough. Breakfast is a scrum of 15-25 people trying to get at the food while you are dodging small children. There are a lot of kids so dont stay if you arent into the kid scene.	environment
Very helpful staff.	service
Clean and comfortable, nice hotel for its price range, good location--we enjoyed our 2-night stay. FYI, the outdoor pool is open until 11 p.m. poolside rooms are fine if you are vacationing with teens or night owls, but if you have toddlers/young children or anyone who prefers to go to bed early in your party, you may want to request a room on another side of the hotel--pool party noise kept us up late the first night (and we WERE the pool party noise the second night when we werent worn out from traveling!) Several choices for breakfast (make-your-own waffles, biscuits and gravy, eggs, sausage, doughnuts, cereal, toast, yogurt, apples, fruit juice, milk, etc.) and you can get small discounts on tickets to several attractions if you purchase vouchers at front desk. The only very minor service/room condition complaints we had were that one of the electrical outlets was pulling out of the wall, that we had to call to request replacement shampoo/conditioner the second night, and also when we requested pool towels shortly before pool closing, we were asked to go to the front desk to get them, as they could not bring them down to the pool towel cabinet for us at that time (no big deal unless youre already wet from the pool, of course!) Overall, our three-room party of extended family had a good experience, and would stay again.	facility,environment,food
My family enjoyed our stay. The room was clean and the price definitely made it worthwhile. We would stay here again.	environment
Staff helpful and informative- room clean. Kids enjoy the pool area.	facility,environment
This hotel was rented for a couple on vacation from Illinois. We are a young couple so money is tight. This hotel was decent and the price could not be beat. The room was a little dirty (like the floor, for example) but I expected it. I do have a few things to caution you of: -The continental breakfast is less than stellar, but it gets the job done -Rooms by the pool are loud.	facility,environment,food
The hotel was very clean and well kept during our stay there. The pool was a decent size and very clean. The breakfast left a little to be desired. Overall for the price it was great. I would stay there again.	facility,environment,food
I was very disappointed. The reservation was messed up when I got there and they had charged my card instead of letting me pay cash as first agreed on. And then the desk person refused to cancel the extra room even though I had not requested it and I had to do my own calling to get problem corrected and I am still not sure it is fixed. Very unhappy with all of it. Room not comfortable. Spider was in my towel. And it did not help to have a room for someone with walking handicap because I had to walk up an incline on the driveway to get to my room. I will never use hotels.com again nor will I ever stay at this motel again. Ever!!!	service,facility
room was clean, breakfast was good stayed 4 days same breakfast every day was good away from attractions which was good no traffic but couldnt walk to anything which was bad but was in central location so it was easy to drive to.	environment,food,location

For starters, hotel staff was great. Very pleasant. However, upon entering the room, I discovered that it needed to be vacuumed and the bathroom was a bit dated. When I woke the next morning, I could see sunshine coming through the edges of the door. While I wasnt concerned for my safety, I did wonder how many bugs were coming to visit me during the night!!	service,facility

The stay at this hotel was a good experience for me and our entourage. Room was decent and in a quiet area. Staff was good, but the hotel needs to better improve their handicapped parking area near the main entrance.	service,facility,environment
Older hotel that could use some refreshing. Initial room smelled of cat urine. Comforter was old and tattered. Sitting chairs were stained. Staff was helpful. Moved to another room w/o incident. Overall satisfaction was fair. For a few dollars more could get something nicer. Breakfast was very good.	service,facility,food
Great price thru Hotels.com, manager could not believe the rate. Not on the strip, convenient access to Hwy 76, Shows Silver Dollar City. Breakfast was better than most motel breakfasts.	food
Hot breakfast was great! Staff pleasant and accommodating. Great location with new restaurant next door. Outdoor pool was clean. Free Wi-Fi was hit with the kids. Would stay there again.	service,facility,food
Affordable place to stay. Coffee pot in room, fridge clean but a little outdated.	facility,environment
It has been years since Ive stayed in a Days inn but based on the rate and location I decided to go ahead and book my room there. I was very pleasantly surprised. I expected a very basic motel and was surprised at the spaciousness and quality of the room and extra perks, eg. breakfast, refrig. etc. I will certainly consider staying at a Days Inn again.	food,location
Managet talked over us and wouldnt listen 2 us. Put us n wrong room. Bed was a bowl and killed our back and hips. 2nd room ac didnt work right, bathroom door didnt shut all the way, bathroom vent sounded like a freight train, could hear vents n other rooms.	facility
Very nice and Drafts Pub Grille just opened next door. Very handy.	location
Nice hotel for the price. The staff was very friendly with a great attitude. The only bad thing I can say about my stay was the fitted sheets for the king size bed didnt fit and I had to keep waking up to put them back on.	service,facility
This hotel was great. Nice area, clean, and close to strip and outlet stores. Only negative was the the shower head needed to be a foot higher. Im 6ft and I had a hard time washing my hair. Any taller than 57, you will have some trouble showering here. Other than that, I would of given this hotel a 5 but I would stay here again.	facility
It was a good stay. Didnt stay in room much for all the shopping and Silver Dollar City. Was so glad they have football channels so we could was our team win. This is the first hotel that the refrigerator kept our drinks and food cold. Sink water was hard to turn on and then it would spray water on you. Would stay there again.	facility
We had a great stay. I definitely appreciated having the a/c cranked up when I walked into the room, especially since it was 100 that day! Room was comfortable and decent rate. Thanks!	facility
Front desk was friendly and helpful! Discovered a waterfall hiking trail around the corner where we could walk dogs. Great biscuits and gravy breakfast!	service,food
1 of the queen beds was broken in room. Very uncomfortable sleep that night.	facility

It was way to loud and no way we could have got into the pool. If I was you I would never go without shoes in the room the carpet was so nasty. And the rooms seem very dark.	facility
Everything about this hotel was great. It was convenient to many activities. Good free breakfast selection. We did not have an opportunity to use the pool because of the weather.	facility,food
My wife and I stayed here recently on our first visit to Branson. The room was clean and updated. The breakfast in the morning was ample and lots of variety. The staff was friendly and very helpful. We booked a show through the hotel at the tribute theater that was a hoot. I would definitely stay here again. Would be a good central location if I was staying with my whole family also. Lots to do in the area.	service,environment,food,location
We thought the hotel was a little tired looking. Drawer handles on the dresser were loose, things like that. The breakfast was the same every day would have liked a little more variety. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The maid service was not very thorough at times, i.e. pulling the sheet up and tucking it in without making sure the mattress pad was in place.	service,facility,food
All facilities including Swimming Pool are very clean. Staff are very friendly. Hotel is centrally located.Great Value for Money.	service,facility,environment
Hotel is in bad need of repair. Room was old, sink had damage, trim falling apart in bathroom , shower curtain bar so loose, shower curtain was at my feet, yuck.Bed ancient with icky old bed spreads. Should be put in one star category. The staff was the best part of this place.	service,facility
Decent. Good location. Made it easy to get around Branson.	location
The staff were very friendly and courteous,room were clean and the facilities in the hotel good. The continental breakfast has a wide range of choices.	service,facility,environment,food
The Hotel was a little dated but still in pretty good condition. The breakfast was outstanding and had a great selection. The eating area was a little small for the crowd that came to breakfast, it just shows how good it was. I would stay here again and I will recommend it to friends and family.	food
The room was simple for the trip but didnt like the fact that the room didnt include a microwave which should be standard.	facility
Lets start with the positives. Great location to everything and the staff were super friendly. Now the negatives. Dated and a bit worn, not to my liking and certainly not to my wive and kids either. There were bugs in the room. The kind that fly and some in the bed. We were very displeased and embarrassed. I will not return.	service,environment,location
There was a mix-up with Hotel.com, but the hotel staff connected with Hotel.com and both businesses worked it out for us. We highly appreciated that. We were given a room close to Lobby and over the pool, so it was a rather noisy room, but very convenient for our needs. The hotel couldnt help that the volley ball team yelled and ran up down stairs balconies. Just what one has to put up with during the busiest tourist season. However, with the help of the continuous running fan, the wonderful soft bed pillows being so tired, we rested very well. Breakfast was good had something for the diabetic diet, but super crowded. Probably half the folks had to take breakfast back to their rooms.	service,facility,food
We rented 2 rooms with double beds, in both rooms the beds were very worn out. NOT COMFORTABLE.	facility
I went to Branson for 4th of July so there were VERY few affordable options as every hotel raised its prices. I paid close to double the price of what this hotel normally goes for. So I was already paying more than I should (beds and pillows were very uncomfortable) and on top of it, they have a ridiculous pet policy. 10 extra per night is not bad - its the mandatory 50 cleaning fee whether the animal makes a mess or not. Paid way more than I should for an establishment that did not earn that value.	service
Nothing fancy but met our needs. Quiet, convenient and staff very friendly and helpful. Beds were very comfortable.	service,facility,environment
Price was a deal. Serving the breakfast saved us a lot of money. The family enjoyed their stay.	food

We stayed here for Luther Family weekend in September. We could not get a hotel in Decorah Iowa and this was the next closest place. It is a small hotel with a small parking lot. Friday night when we checked in we were greeted and given our key, and it is literally a key not the credit card looking keys.	facility,location
I stayed here because I had a family wedding to attend. It definitely had a country feel with quilts and flannel linens. The motel was very clean, and felt comfortable. My room had a microwave and refrigerator. The wi-fi was slow, but usable. I would stay here again.	facility,environment
Stayed here for Parents Weekend at Luther College in Decorah. Other accommodations were full in town, and this is about 20 minutes away. The motel is a basic older motel. Weve stayed here once before, and found it clean, so returned. This time I was less entranced. There are two buildings and we were in a different building this time.	facility,environment
The place was easy to find, right on the main drag. Within walking distance to the shopping downtown. The room was clean, had all the amenities, blowdryer, fridge, microwave, clothes iron, coffee maker. Very slightly shabby but homey. Price was affordable. I would stay there again.	facility,environment
We checked into our hotel on a busy Friday night, in this quaint little hotel. We have stayed here several times before and always are reassured that we will have another beautiful weekend, with very comfortable accommodations. The hotel is only about 20 minutes from the college, located in the small town of Harmony. The same family has owned.	location
We stayed here while touring around SE Minnesota. It was a great place to stay and visit some of the sites in the area. The motel is very clean and the room was large with a very comfortable bed. The owners were very helpful with ideas on what to see and how to get there. On Saturday there were Amish.	facility,environment
Harmony was a good location for me, but other reviews of this motel made me reluctant to try it. Very glad I did. It looks like a chain hotel, right on main highway. Phone was answered on first try to make a reservation. Very friendly staff. Efficient check in. Helpful with directions to trail head. Room 103 was clean.	service,environment,location
Very conveniently located, but I wasnt impressed. Had a chance to meet both owners, and they were friendly, but person who was working the desk when we checked in was a bit aloof and cool. Room was old, and the fan/light in the ceiling was shaking so badly that I thought it would fall down on us.	facility,location
This summer, we brought our kids to visit the Amish village near the hotel before school started. We chose the Country Lodge Inn for our stay, which was a pleasant experience for us. Friendly, clean, and very comfortable place to stay. Definitely would choose to come again.	environment,location
The rooms are clean and the owners are friendly. It feels like your own home. The hotel is in the middle of many scenic areas. There is a biking trail that covers the Preston valley, apple orchards, and caverns, and there are Amish families in the area. On Saturday mornings the Amish have a farmers market where they sell baked.	environment

We were really happy with our choice of this hotel for a 5 night stay in the city. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite which was classically decorated to a very high standard and had a four poster king bed. The kitchen was very well equipped and included full size fridge, microwave and hob.	facility
This is the perfect place to stay if you are planning for more than a couple of days stay in Boston. The rooms at Inn at St Botolphs are more like cute little apartments than hotel rooms. The decor is funky/eclectic and the space, while compact, is utilized well.	facility
I spent three days in this wonderful hotel, the price was reasonable, and its really clean. if you travel with your family, I recommend this Inn for you to choose. you can cook and make your own food for your kids if they can not stand American food. I like this place, and will come choose again when I go.	environment,food
I stayed at this hotel on a last minute Boston getaway and found it clean, spacious and very conveniently located. I booked a second reservation with the Inn at St. Botolph for Parents Weekend at my daughters university. Because these types of events often create shortages in hotel rooms, I booked early. I just looked at my credit card bill.	environment
We had a nice experience here. The place is like a small apartment and felt like it. Pros: excellent location- around the corner from the T and walking distance to many shops, restaurants, and Prudential Center. The rooms are nicely decorated and updated bathroom. It was easy to enter and exit our building and get going for the day.	facility,location
This was a trendy boutique hotel right in the city. But because it was one block off the main road, it seems like the burbs...very quiet. Super friendly when asking questions before booking and really like the modern room furnishing. And so convenient to my meetings downtown. And great sushi across the street!	environment
This really felt like home from home. The location is very convenient, near to the T Green Line. The area is full of atmospheric, residential streets and there is the Prudential Center for shops and services. We had a comfortable suite with excellent Wi-Fi included. The set-up is different in that you pay in full on booking.	facility,location
The staff was impressively thoughtful and accommodating. The room had great natural light, lots of space, quiet surroundings and a full kitchen - stove top, refrigerator, toaster, microwave, etc. The kitchen allowed us to not over eat at so many of Bostons fine restaurants and bring leftovers home for in-between meals or snacks. The location was excellent.	service,facility,environment,location
This hotel is located in the residential area but it is in the back bay central area. So if you want to stay in the center but avoid the noise, this is the place. The room is a suite so you may cook. Everything is well designed and has an elegant touch in the room. Staff was super friendly.	service,facility,location
We loved it so much we wanted to live there Perfect location, great snacks in the lounge, beautiful room, clean, nice amenities. The people in the office were very helpful. My only tiny complaint is we arrived early and informed our room would be ready in 30 min and one hour later had to search someone out and then informed.	facility,environment,location
We stayed at the Inn for two nights while visiting Boston. We were able to check in early and get in to our large beautiful studio with a spacious bathroom on the first floor. The Inn was centrally located to the shops at Prudential and the beginning of the Freedom Trail was about a 15 minute walk.	facility,location
The Inn at St. Botolph was the perfect spot for a surprise staycation I planned for my husband! We live in Boston but wanted to experience a different neighborhood! The Inn is conveniently located, and its easy to get to Back Bay and the South End! I love the keyless entry it helped us feel like we really lived there.	environment,location
- You access the room with a personal code that is sent to you in 2 weeks (no keys! and you dont need to communicate with staff) - wifi connection is awesome, all ports are open (SSH, Remote Desktop and other important features for IT-professionals) - Ro.	facility
My recent stay at the Inn was my third time and in addition to it being a great value it is a great small hotel. Spotlessly clean and centrally located all the rooms are small suites that are extremely comfortable. When I visit Boston I am without a car and the Inn is right across the street from the Prudential.	location
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the St Botolph. Loved the neighborhood, convenience, and apartment like feel of the room. It was on a quiet street but only one block from a main road and from the T. Also liked the added amenities in the room like a full size hair dryer, a lighted makeup mirror and nice, thick bathrobes.	facility,environment
Certainly a great location for walking around Boston. Handy to shops and lots of rest/bars etc. within 10 min walk. Apartment has been renovated and at the front top room, is very sunny and pleasant. it was one of the larger rooms. However, the sound proofing was not good and we could hear people in the room next door.	environment,location
This small apartment style accommodation is very nicely placed on historic St Botolph Street but close to the modern city. Its rooms are well equipped and comfortable with facilities for self service meals and food storage. Ideal for our three day Boston visit.	facility,location
Lots if good things to say about this boutique hotel - plus a few grumbles and one major gripe. Great location, very central but on a quiet street, near Copley, Back Bay and the South End, with excellent transport links. Nicely designed and well equipped suites (but see below). Good lighting and even a proper makeup mirror - thank you.	environment,location

We got there and our room wasnt ready for us yet. We were switched to another room and upon inspection of that room we found hair and stains all over the bed. We were then switched to another room that was set for someone with handicap accessibility which is fine but after inquiring about our original room we find out that that room has now been given to someone else. After all the inconvenience therere was no compensation what so ever. Would not give his a recommendation for anyone.	facility
they ran out of shampoo, and their door key maker was busted. they didnt offer any concessions for the inconvenience.	facility

The only problem we had was that the key machine wasnt working so every time we wanted to go back to our room we had to escorted and wait for someone to do so or which was very irritating while on our honeymoon!!!!!!	facility

had reserved 2 Queen beds with sleeper sofa. When I got to the hotel around checkin time, the room given me was 2 Queen with NO sleeper sofa...just a chair in a large room. There was a HUGE stain on the floor in front of the small refrigerator and peeling paint on walls/ceiling of bathroom. The refrigerator was in BAD NEED of defrosting. It looked like the Room 202 that I was given was a last resort room since it had dirty walls/carpet and peeling paint. I paid 139 per night for this room and feel that I was robbed. I asked another guest if their room was clean and they said YES however my room was NOT.	facility,environment

My wife and I came in for a wedding and the hotel staff made sure everything went great. Very nice people who were more than willing to help out.	service
Did I stay at the same hotel as other reviewers This is not NOT an above average accommodation. I liked the room layout and comfortable bed with good linens and pillows. The buffet breakfast was extensive including fruit, eggs and sausage (as well as the ubiquitous waffle maker) and low-sugar syrup. What was strange was how closely the breakfast bar attendant watched my every move. I think she was trying to be responsive, but she asked me what I was looking for every time I glanced at the selections. The cons for me were the age of the furniture and fixtures and the cleanliness. I have never cited cleanliness in a review-I can let a lot of things pass. But I cannot accept obvious, fresh stains on both the bath vanity and kitchenette counter, especially when they wipe away easily with water, suggesting that not even a rag was dragged across them. The hotel staff was very nice, but always a turn-off for me when they walk in from their cigarette break at the front of the hotel as you walk in behind them. Surprisingly this hotel and the Wingate were nearly equally ranked (and priced) on this site. They are not similar in quality. I checked out the Wingate while in town. It has a much nicer lobby and breakfast room, where a hot breakfast is provided, not a continental as described. The room I was shown had newer furniture, granite kitchenette counter and tile tub/shower surround. Closer to town, it has a few stores within walking distance.	service,facility,environment,food,location
I told the lady at the desk that I dont have any complaints with the hotel. We will stay there again.	service
This was an overnight trip to the beach. The location was ok, the road construction mentioned before is still ongoing but a quick u-ie didnt make getting in too terrible. All the members of staff were very friendly. I floated around the pool in the evening, maybe past closing time... perhaps we were quiet enough they didnt kick us out. In the morning I had my heart set on a muffin for breakfast, other than the banana nut and bran that were out, and they searched to no avail. The coffee shop down the road was great (snicker doodle muffin and iced chai, mmmmm)! Location made it easy to get around between Oak Island and Wilmington. Only negative was that the bed was hard. I couldnt seem to get comfortable at all.	facility,food,location

Ecellent and fiendly staff.all very positive including full breakfast.	service,food
This is a nice hotel. The road construction makes it fairly dangerous to get in to but once in the parking lot, it is it OK. While we were very impressed with everyone and everything during our first two days we were absolutely disgusted on Sunday. We left our room early Sunday and returned that evening to find our room had been left open ALL DAY - with dirty towels stacked in front of our door to keep it open and the bed left unmade - and ALL of our personal items (computers, phones, etc.) left out for anyone and everyone to peruse. And after being made aware we were still charged full price for our room with nothing more than a oh - sorry about that. It is a shamed that the week end crew with obviously NO management at all - could ruin the reputation of the regular staff who seemed to take some pride in the property.	service,environment
We had a great time. First time traveling with our dog. They made all of us feel welcone. Great breakfast buffet and lots of little touch that just added to the experience. The staff were very friendly and accmodating. We would recommend this hotel to everyone. We will be back :)	service,food

We stayed after the very busy Memorial Day Week end. The key card machine had broke due to the large number of patrons over the week end. The staff were very friendly and walked us to our rooms to open the door and were staffed for coming and going due to this unusual situation.	service,facility
I stayed 3 nights at Comfort Suites. The staff is very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. The room was large and very comfortable. There is a lovely swimming pool outside. The location, half way between Southport and Oak Island, is very convenient and there are plenty of sights, beaches, and things to do in the close surroundings. The neighborhood is safe and there is plenty of parking space. I enjoyed the nice breakfast. If you stay on a busy week-end, the breakfast room gets packed and there is unfortunately not enough space for everyone to be sitting. This is the only downside to this wonderful and very affordable hotel in a great location.	service,facility,environment,food,location
We were attending a wedding at Bald Head Island, and being from out of town, we needed to get a hotel. It was only for one night, and we didnt want to spend a lot of money, as we were only going to be in the room to sleep. We were very impressed with this hotel. It wasnt expensive, but it was very , very nice. Spotlessly clean...staff very helpful and friendly.	service,environment
The hotel staff was friendly and the check-in / check-out process was simple. The room stayed clean and the bed was comfortable. The TV seemed to have the wrong picture format set on the hotel side of the broadcast to the room. When attempting to watch the Olympics, the left and right edges of the broadcast were cut-off and not visible. The parking lot is a touch too small for the amount of rooms available, at times it may be difficult to find a parking spot if returning to the hotel late at night. The location of the hotel being on the corner of NC-211 and NC-133 creates some difficulty getting in and out of the parking lot. My wife and I were able to drive into Southport for shopping and restaurants also visit Oak Island a little further south for the beaches.	service,facility,environment,food,location
Our stay was a pleasant, overnight stay. The room was clean and comfortable. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The complimentary breakfast was tasty. Aside from the hotel having a tiny, swimming pool, I have nothing but praise. I am a picky person especially when it comes to cleanliness. I would not hesitate to return and plan to do so in the future. Go. Stay. Enjoy. Its a great value for the price.	service,facility,environment,food

Our room was clean and comfortable except the throw size pillows on the bed. We did have an issue with the toilet overflowing the first day we arrived. The cleaning lady came by and cleaned it up and gave us a plunger. It continued to stop up/drain slow for the remainder of our two day stay. We did report it to the front desk, but whether anyone actually checked it out, I cant say. Other than being a nuisance, it wasnt a big issue. As for the location, we expected there to be more in South Port and were disappointed with the town overall. Next time we will stay at Carolina Beach or in Wilmington, which both have more things to do.	service,facility,environment
Expedia really screwed up our reservations and the staff went way out of their way to fix things. If it were not for the staff we would have been sleeping on the street and paying to do so. I will be very reluctant to ever book through Expedia again.	service
This trip was for a pleasant day at Oak Island It turn into a complete waste of time due to extreme traffic and construction in the area. The line was literally 10 mile back ups. Local traffic a mess Waiting in traffic to go to dinner for nearly 1-2 hrs. Hotel was a complete mess They had no key reader for your hotel room so every time you wanted to get back in you would have to get someone at front desk to let you in. What awful stay and a waste of my money!!! Would not recommend ! By the way they hide dirt well. Nasty.	facility,environment
Didnt like the bathroom overhead light and fan being controlled by same switch. It disturbs the sleeping person when one goes to the bathroom.	facility
Really enjoyed our stay. The beds are very comfy and the staff very friendly. The lady that cooked breakfast named Vicki did an awesome job on breakfast and was helpful to us with questions we had about the island.	service,facility,food
A web sight highly rated this hotel. For this reason and with a good rate, I booked the hotel.As is our practice, we bring wipes to clean the phone, door knobs, TV remote and bathroom etc. We found all of the above dirty. The bath grab handle was all mold. We covered the handle when the tub was used. I did not complain to the hotel because the were begining a remodel of the public bath which led me to believe their answer would be remodeling.	facility,environment
I will definitely be staying here again. The middle aged woman at the front desk (I cant remember her name) was very polite and very helpful. She gave me a neat little map of the whole area and told me and my wife where good places to eat and visit. Our room was clean and setup really nice. The breakfast was good. I will be coming back here next time I visit this side of the beach.	service,food,location
Room was clean, attractive and well priced. Staff was friendly. My only critique is that the dining room is a little small for the size of the hotel and there is some road work that made entering the parking lot a little confusing (obviously the latter is not the hotels fault.).	service,environment
Spent 2 nights in Southport. Furniture in room appeared older and worn in appearance.however they seem to be renovating. Very nice breakfast.TV service was poor.Most channels not working,luckily we were not in the room except at night the one negative about this stay was the traffic construction in front of the hotel which was a extreme hardship to entering and exiting.	facility,food
Could use an update on a few things... Noticed mold in shower and such but overall good experience!	facility
This is a good hotel with quick access to oak island or down town Southport. The room was bigger than we anticipated. Which was nice. Front desk staff was friendly. Only negative was the road construction going on overnight. It was loud at times. Wish we slept on the other side of the hotel. But thats temporary. When finished we will stay there again.	service,location
The staff was very friendly and efficient. An added touch was the fresh popcorn made each afternoon. It was a welcome surprise. Another feature that adds to my stay is the inclusion of breakfast and a fresh cup of coffee. My only complaint is that sound was easily heard between rooms. It seems many hotels have this problem. Other than that I have a very pleasant stay.	service,food
It was in the middle of all the town we were able to drive to.	location
On the way into Southport and convenient to going into town and the restaurants.	location
Worst hotel experience ever. The hotels card reader was broken so no key was given out. They simply wrote down your room number and you had to ask someone to let you in your room every time. So anyone could have gotten in my room at any time. Plus the staff expressed how annoyed they were by having to do this. I felt as if I could never leave my room. Was not offered a discount or an apology. Will never go back.	service,facility
Large room, very nice overall.	environment
I enjoyed the hotel accommodations. The staff was polite but not very helpful. I discovered stuff on my own. The room was clean,comfortable quiet.	service,environment
Everything was great from check-in to checkout except that we had to go to another floor for ice and I had to track down housekeeping staff to change sheets and bring more clean towels. We were out for several hours and expected this done when we got back to our room.	service,facility
Nice room with ample space and a comfortable bed. Breakfast was scrambled eggs and bicuits and gravy. waffles and assorted juces and fruits.	facility,food
The bed on the floor above us was super noisy. I asked the Front Desk to change our room and they were able to do so. Breakfast wasnt very tasty.	service,facility,food
We werent in the room much but the bed was comfortable, had all the basic amenities besides hot breakfast, pool (we didnt get to use), etc. it was clean. We werent really near much but beaches, other cities werent too far away. Enjoyed our stay there.	facility,environment,food
great place to stay breakfast was awesome.	food
The room was nice clean. We thought we were going to have problems with dogs barking in other rooms but they settled down. There were children running around above us it was late! They settled down too! The breakfast was good. Overall not too bad. I have a suggestion though it would be good to put the folk with pets on one floor in the event someone coming in is allergic to pet hair.	environment,food
Room could use upgrades. It is not walking distance to beach. better to pay the extra to stay closer to beach and restaurants.	location
The hotel was great for our stay. It was a couples trip for beach week. The only things I didnt like was the cleanliness of the bathroom. And as a women thats a big part of staying in the hotel.	environment
Not a bad stay , hotel could use a remodel. .nice to have a 24 hr restaurant on premises. .pool was nice as well. .Id book again.	facility,food

Went to Virginia Beach to pick up our son from deployment. Checked into our hotel on Friday evening. Went to our room, which looked nice at first. Looked under the mattress only to find a bedbug. Manager tried to say it was a cockroach. They did offer to upgrade our room but I just wanted a refund. I only got refunded one night and lost my money for the second night. Definitely would not recommend staying there.	service,environment

We atayed at the hotel from 7/3-7/6. The room was old, smelly, bathtub was broken, toilet seat was burned and the water presure was incosistent. Carpet was old and dirty. Room service came one time and just made our beds with all that was in our bed such as cheerios and babys toys. They did not change our towels or clean the bathroom. Water in the pool was cold. Lot of noise around the pool did not make our stay relaxing. They charged 220 per night. It is such a shame to rip off hard working American people just bc they wanted to celebrate their most important holiday July 4th. This room is not worth 30. Would not recomend this hotel to anyone.	facility
Refrigerators was rusted.	facility
Got a headache every time I went to the room. I think mold is in the walls. There were bugs in our beds. I didnt stay the second night that we had paid for.	environment
This was a true nightmare. The add stated it was oceanfront, it wasnt! the front door would not lock. It had gray duct on the lock section, which was painted it over. It appeared to be a place for squatters. It was not safe. The furniture was old, outdated and it smelled. And we couldnt get a refund!	service,facility
The Hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were fine. There was a mini fridge, microwave, hair dryer, and ironing board/iron. However the showers were awful. The water would get scalding hot and then ice cold. At first we thought it was because everyone was returning from the beach but it continued. The Hotel is in a great location-5 block walk to beach, boardwalk, restaurants, shops and entertainment. The pool was nice with not many people there. All in all experience was fine-I would probably return because the price was good and the only bad thing was the showers.	service,facility,location
The door to our room was broke and didnt even shut and latch. We just pushed it open all the time. The guest service was disorganized at desk and not very friendly. The hotel needs a lot more maintenance.	service,facility
There is ample parking which is great because we would walk or ride our bikes to the beach everyday. We didnt move our car once. The bed was pretty comfortable and clean. The TV was nice and having a fridge and microwave was convenient. There were so many mirrors so there was no issue when getting ready. There was tons of counter space for toiletries inside and outside the bathroom. The bathroom needed and update and good cleaning, but nothing we couldnt handle. We actually booked another room to stay a night longer than expected and we were able to stay in the same room. It was a very easy process.	facility,environment
It suited us as needed a Simple accommodations with basic amenities. In process of renovation. Location was not ideal with no food or coffee had to drive to get one.	facility,location
The front desk personnel were great. I will return. Since I work in the travel business, I would recommend.	service
The hotel charged additional fee for persons over 12 years old. The hotel did not provide facial tissues. The previous hotel guest left his watch in the room. He phoned back to ask us to look for the watch. When we found the watch, I informed the hotel staff and asked that they return the watch to the patron.	facility
WiFi did not work well the entire stay.	facility
I hate reading reviews online because the negative ones are usually from people who usually dont travel a lot and are used to 5 star hotels. This hotel is great for location to the convention center and the beach. My husband and I stayed one night for a dance competition at the convention center. Service was decent, room was clean, and we felt safe in the neighborhood. Its literally 60 seconds from the convention center, so the location was perfect. Would definitely stay here again.	environment,location
It was horrible the housekeeper was kept knocking on door after we asked her to clean the room after we left see goes to get manager he harassed us and threatened us cops were called it just was a mess rooms were smelly and hot i would not recommend this hotel to a dog.	environment
They had bed bugs badly.	environment
Me and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel for two nights. I was hesitant at first from reading previous reviews.. but we had a delightful stay! We had a king size bed which was very comfortable. No issues checking in since we are 19. The room was clean, we got sick during our stay and threw up all over the bed and floor and room service had no problems cleaning everything up. Good distance from the beach.. not that close but a few blocks down. I would definitely stay here again.	facility,environment,location
The front staff was very professional and courteous. The cleanliness of the room could have been better, but overall not bad. The neighborhood during The day is great for walking. At night I would not go walking without my husband.	service,location
I didnt mind it being out of date but the it not being clean and the insects was more than I could tolerate. The condition of one the beds was so bad it couldnt be slept in. Even before going to bed I canceled the rest of the reservation and couldnt wait to get out in the morning.	facility,environment
It was not comfortable at all. Room smelled like smoke.	environment
Not a quick walk to the beach, but clean and spacious room. Hotel very strict on their no cancellation policy if you choose that option. They did offer to look for something we left in the room and called us back with a response.	environment,location
All the staff was very friendly and the room was nicely cleaned every day with fresh towels, etc. The staff found my wifes gold earring while cleaning and placed it clearly on a table that we found on our return. Also, great, clean pool.	service,facility,environment
Last min booking, it was hard to get the water hot. And when you did shower the rug in the room would get wet.	facility
The room was clean, thats the best I can say about it. The hotel is older and pretty shabby, absolutely plain, no decoration, no prettying up anywhere. Just very basic, very plain, not especially nice but not horrible. Overpriced, considering the bare-ness of the whole place.	environment
Good hotel for the price. Convenient location. Short walk to the beach and boardwalk. Friendly, accommodating and helpful staff.	service,location
We enjoyed the stay here. The room was clean, comfortable, and though the area is right off of a main thoroughfare, it was amazingly quiet. Management was great! I appreciate greatly the favor that was done by giving a second chance to a disturbance in one of our rooms. It just goes to prove that meeting anger with respect means a lot. I also appreciate management accepting the apologies that were given for the disturbance.	service,environment
Convenient location for day-trips in Monterey-Ft. Ord area. Larger than average rooms, and in decent condition, but all the carpets reeked of cleaner, in the hallways, the stairway, and the room. The staff was very friendly (a big plus!), but there were a few small maintenance issues. This was entirely acceptable (except the smell) for our mountain-bike racing overnight,but would probably have disappointed us when the kids were little and we came to Monterey for the Aquarium. 	facility,environment,location,service
Had to switch rooms because sink was plugged。	facility
This was a pleasant surprise. Though we have been to Monterey many times, we had never visited Marina. It was a convenient and affordable place to stay for the Big Sur Marathon. 	location
The hotel was going through some remodeling by the stacks of sofa beds outside. Breakfast was good, waffles, hard boiled eggs, yogurt fruit, pastries.

Very nice stay - room was quiet, clean and comfortable. Staff was friendly and helpful.

My husband and I booked a one-night stay here because our daughter was having a baby, but we had to stay a second night. Fortunately the hotel had a room for the second night, just not the same room. The first night our room faced the street, so there was traffic noise with the window open. The next night we faced the parking lot. The bed in the first room was like sleeping on a rock. We like a firm mattress, but this was ridiculous. The second night, the bed was much better, firm without being rock-hard. That room was huge with two king beds and a sofa bed. It could have very comfortably slept 6 people without feeling crowded. Both rooms had a microwave, refrigerator, and coffee maker. The bathrooms were also large, and the second room had a spa tub. During the stay I interacted with four different employees--all very pleasant. Breakfast was good, the usual cereals, yogurt, fruit, waffles, muffins, juice, coffee. The first day they had hard-boiled eggs, but the second day they were out. I missed the protein. There were several restaurants nearby, but we didnt go to any of them so I dont have a recommendation. The parking lot is fairly small, so if you have a large vehicle I would suggest parking in a place where youll be able to get out easily. Our only complaint was the very poor internet service. The desk clerk gave us an Ethernet cord, but that didnt help. We were here midweek, and the price was reasonable. We would definitely stay here again. 	facility,environment,service,food
I was expecting two queen beds, but to my surprise and delight we had two king sized beds. Not much else to say, we knew going in there was no pool, but the beds were great, what we needed. 	facility
The Manager was very friendly and accommodating. Felt safe. Breakfast was convenient too. Had begin my day very early. 	environment,service,food
Very friendly staff, had a hardl time understanding them with the language barrier. 	service
We ordered a room with two queen beds and got a room with two king size beds, but set for people with limited accessibility. thus, the beds were great, but the room and specifically the bathroom was organised in a wired way, including a shower hose that lines over you when you take the sower. But overall our experience was positive. 	facility,environment
Cars parked on the street caused some dangerous situations while leaving parking lot. Currently being remodeled so was unable to use gym. 	facility,environment
I recently stayed here for work l. I typically stay at a cheaper motel because of the cost but decided it get myself a nice room for once. The main thing that attracted me to this place is the fact that it said it had a spa tub. Well to my disappointment the thing didnt work. It also says that the room has premiun cable and that was also a disappointment its basic cable and no HD...heck even motel 6 has HDTV. All around its a decent room but definitely not for the price ive stayed at bettermotels here in the area for less money. 	facility
Stay 2 night with my family during our getaway to Monterey. Great location: local restaurants and supermarkets are only 5-15 mins away. Room is clean and friendly staff. 	environment,location,service

Family of 5 traveling to Monterey but hotels were way too expensive and when you enter 5 guests they want you to get 2 rooms. This hotel had 2 king beds that we could easily sleep comfortably in. Room was comfortable, also had a desk with office chair and a table with 2 chairs to snack at. Parking was fine and free. They have a free breakfast they was great,bagels, bread, English, muffins, Danish, waffles, juice, coffee, cereal, and fruit. For a family of 5 breakfast is at least 45-50 at a restaurant. Only slightly negative is caulking at the bathtub floor was not clean looking. But no reason to touch it anyways. Would definitely return here. 	facility,environment,food
A good hotel for the value. They can improve the cleaning and the service is just ok. The rooms are comfy. 	environment,service
We had a all the kids with us and it was a large suite with new carpet and fresh paint. Comfortable beds and rooms. Bathrooms needed to be updated but it was still nice. 	facility
The service provided by the staff and management at this hotel is horrible. We were there on February 20th with a late night check in and the manager on duty was short, rude and showed no interest in providing any level of service at all. 	service
Really friendly helpful service at night ! Early morning help was not friendly ! When we checked out the front desk was very friendly. 	service
The room was very big which was really nice and I really like the fact that there wasnt a lot of outside noise that interrupted our sleep. That is a plus! Breakfast was good. We were able to check in early! I would stay here again. 	environment,food

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. 	environment,location,service
This is a good hotel for people who just want to spend a couple days. Its clean/safe its located close to beaches like Monterey Carmel. Lots of stores w/in walking/driving distance including fast foods restaurant. Nothing fancy about this hotel but our room is quite spacious for a 2 King Beds (all rooms non-smoking).

The room was big, which was nice. The carpets were not vacuumed properly, the bathtub was dirty I had to clean it myself before getting in it, there was something smeared on a wall(looked like male bodily fluids), it looked like someone threw up on the bedskirt and the blankets all had holes in them. Its safe to say that I am very surprised this hotel received such great ratings. It was dirty...I wanted to scrub the lobby floors myself! The two male employees we dealt with at the front desk were pleasant and friendly. But, I wont be staying here again. 	facility,environment,service
I spent MLK weekend at the hotel and it was wonderful. The room was huge for the price. Ive spent more at smaller places. We had a deluxe King and it was bigger than a studio. Very nice and clean. Wish the tv would have been a bit bigger considering how big the space was. It was a bit hard to see from the couch. There was some remodeling upgrades being done so my only complaints were the strong stench of paint paint thinner in the halls, However, a slight oversight considering its for repairs. Also the ice machine on our floor was out of service so we had to go all the way to the lobby every time. Both the day and evening clerk were very nice. We had food delivered to the room because it was storming but there were tons of places to chose from. Less than 10 minutes from the beach. Wish there were places near home as nice because I stay in hotels often between work and travel. I would absolutely stay there again. I slept almost a whole day it was so peaceful. I have family in Monterey who stay about 5 minutes from the hotel so this place will definitely be my go to when Im in town. 	facility,environment,location

after staying at the Deluxe Inn in Merrillville Indiana for 3 weeks due to business.

I have been visiting Pittsburgh for some years and we have always used this Super 8. I like the owner operators. The hotel is sometimes noisy when guests are inconsiderate late at night. But this is still a great deal for budget travelers. 	environment,service
For the 70 plus a night it costs, this hotel is no bargain. Crummy, bare-bones continental breakfast no public computer, and horrible internet connectivity in the rooms not cleaned behind the night stand or dresser in a while, it seems no coffee packets left 2 days in a row in the room cheap, tiny soap, scratchy cheap towels- low budget all the way- except for the cost. 	facility,food
The beds were very comfortable, the place was quiet, the breakfast was fine, and the front desk staff was pleasant. Bathroom mirror was a little spotted, and the paint job in there was pretty sloppy, but this was a fine choice for an inexpensive motel. Id stay here again. 	facility,environment,service,food
The motel was further out of town than I expected and the surrounding area had quite the rural feel. The lobby and corridors matched that underwhelming feeling too. However fortunately the room itself was very nice and very clean. This motel allows smoking and the hallways had a noticeable tobacco odor, fortunately the smell did not invade my room and I could not smell it inside my room. GPS/MAP CAUTION - GPS/Google Maps sometimes has difficulty locating since the address is Golden Mile Highway but access is actually off of Old Frankstown Road. I suggest looking at a map/satellite view carefully before driving there just to see the actual location. 	environment,location

We were pleased with our stay at the Mainsail. The room was nice and the location was very convenient to the beach.

We just spent a weekend at the Main Sail in Hampton and it fulfilled the expectations set by other reviews here. The hotel has had many substantial upgrades and is very comfortable. The overall feel is still very much the classic 1960s/1970s motel, but it is fresh, airy, and very clean. The owners are friendly and attentive to the guests. 	environment,service
We stayed in Hampton NH for the celebration of my daughters wedding. The staff at the Mainsail was very accommodating to us.

I am actually here right now. The rooms are a bit dated but everything here is great. I travel quite a bit for work, so Im no stranger to hotels.

We stayed in a 3 bedroom cottage, the place was clean and bright. This was our second year in a row and will never look anywhere else. Short walk to the beach but if we wanted to avoid the sand their pool is very refreshing and inviting. 	facility,location
Great property to stay at while visiting Hampton Beach. Owners are onsite with their dog Clarence and always around greeting and helping guests and cleaning property. Wonderful, hard working and attentive staff and very clean accommodations. So centrally located within minutes from the beach. Clean pool and grounds and a great restaurant just across the street with some of the. 	facility,environment,location,service

We had a fantastic time and the staff was so friendly. The rooms were very clean and the location was nice. We also love having the pool to relax at when we are done with the beach. Our only bad complaint was that we had another family upstairs with children and the children were running so early in the morning. 	facility,environment,location,service
My husband and I stayed at the Mainsail for Memorial Day weekend. We were in town to see a show at the Casino Ballroom and the Mainsail, although was not on the main road in town, was in a perfect location. The beach was just a block a away, but we didnt have the crowds from the main road. 	location

Failed to tell me when booking the room there was a 20 per night charge for incidentals as the front desk clerk called it when I check my bank statement was in fact charged 69.50 not 60.00 as we were told. Front desk clerk assured me the money would be refunded immediately to my card yet 2 days later its. 	service
My grandparents stayed here and they said it was a nice hotel. They people at the front desk were nice and fast. They said the beds were very comfortable and the room was very clean. The only thing they did not like was that it was noisy (they guessed from the team that was staying there) and their juice machine. 	facility,environment,service

Good location for East Peoria hotel. Hotel seemed new. Rooms very clean. Parking lot was well let. Breakfast was good and free. I like the suite style rooms, although they are a bit small. Good for a night or town out of town. Would stay again. 	facility,environment,food
We stayed at the Fairfield Inn in East Peoria on Nov. 21. We were greeted by Isa at check in. Isa, was very welcoming and told us about Christmas Parade that evening. We were not interested in the parade, but, she did give us map showing the route to avoid. Massie, was also very helpful and she brought a couple. 	service

Stayed here for one night for a softball tournament in Pekin. The hotel is OK, but probably will stay elsewhere next year. The bathroom could have been cleaner, specifically the shower. Also, there is no refrigerator in the rooms, so dont bring back any food leftovers. I thought refrigerators were pretty standard in hotels nowadays. Also, breakfast is included in.	facility,environment,food
This 1-night stay was part of an 18-day roadtrip, exclusively at Marriott-branded hotels. Very nice stay at this comfortable hotel, conveniently located. Quiet location, and everyone slept well. Would stay here again if in the area. 	environment,location
